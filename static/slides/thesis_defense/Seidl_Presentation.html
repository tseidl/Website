## What is Digital Capitalism?


&lt;br&gt; 

**cap·i·tal·ism** /ˈkæpɪ̈tl̩ˌɪzm̩/

&amp;#x25B6; **noun** a social order in which the institutionalization of profit-seeking creates an internal dynamism that not only incessantly revolutionizes the economy from within but constantly - and contestedly - runs up against, subverts, and incorporates the institutions in which the economy is embedded.

**dig·it·al cap·i·tal·ism** /ˈdɪd͡ʒɪtəɫ ˈkæpɪ̈tl̩ˌɪz/

&amp;#x25B6; **noun** a form of capitalism in which platform-based, data-driven, and artificial-intelligence-powered business models are capturing an increasing share of profits, control – directly or indirectly – an increasing share of economic life, and increasingly serve as role models for start-ups as well as established companies.

## Two Observations on Technological Change

&lt;br&gt;


&gt; *"Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral"* &amp;mdash; Kranzberg's First Law of Technology


&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The rise of digital capitalism entails


- **disruption**

- **commodification**

.pull-right[


&gt; *"Technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions"* 
&amp;mdash; Kranzberg's Fourth Law of Technology

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The politics of digital policymaking is 



- **ideationally and institutionally embedded**

## Lessons Learned &amp; Courses Charted

- Lessons:

  - There is no digital destiny, but a series of discursive and political fights about what digitalization is and how it should be responded to
  - Ideas matter, and so do institutions that foster a sense of common ownership of policy problems
  
  
- Directions:

  - Linking qualitative and quantitative analyses more closely (e.g., nested analysis)
  - Looking at the entire policy-cycle (e.g., from agenda-setting to regulatory afterlives)
  - Connecting the analysis of digital capitalism to the politico-economic literature (e.g., comparative institutional advantages in the digital age)
  - Focusing more on the multi-level nature of digital policymaking (e.g., geopolitics of digital standard-setting)

## The WP29 Working Paper and the Final GDPR

&lt;table class="table" style="font-size: 12px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; WP29 Position Paper (2009) &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; GDPR 2016 &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Introduce a new ‘Privacy by Design’ principle (pp. 12-15) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Introduces a new ‘Privacy by Default and by Design’ principle (GDPR Art. 25) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Introduce a new ‘accountability’ principle (p. 20) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Introduces a new ‘accountability’ principle (Art. 5§2) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Increase data controllers’ responsibilities; introduce data protection impact assessments; reinforce the role of data protection officers (p. 20) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Increases data controllers´ responsibilities; data protection impact assessments are introduced; reinforces the role of data protection officers (GDPR Art. 35-39) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Improve redress mechanisms and introduce class action lawsuits (p. 16) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Improves redress mechanisms and strengthens the role of public interest groups for the enforcement of rights (GDPR Chapter VIII, particularly Art. 80) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Improve transparency; introduce data breach notifications (for high risk breaches) (p. 16, 21) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Improves transparency; data breach notifications become obligatory (for high risk breaches) (GDPR Section 1 and Art. 34) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Strengthen consent requirements (p. 17) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Strengthens consent requirements (GDPR Art. 7) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Give clear institutional, functional and material independence to the DPAs, as the 1995 directive´s Art. 28 was unclear (pp. 21-22) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Strengthens functional (Art. 52§1), institutional (Art. 52§2,5) and material (Art. 52§3,4,6) independence of DPAs &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Clarify DPA´s enforcement powers, as the 1995 directive’s Art. 28 only contain 3 subparagraphs on enforcement (p. 22) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Contains 16 subparagraphs on investigative and corrective powers (Art. 58§1,2) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Extend legislative advisory powers. WP29 opinions should be addressable more actors (e.g. national parliaments) and treat more issues than ‘administrative measures and regulations’ (p.22) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Extends the scope of the DPA’s opinions to more actors (e.g. national parliaments) and to ‘any issue related to the protection of personal data’ (Art. 58§3b) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Strengthen the WP29 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Renames WP29 to ‘European Data Protection Board’ with broadened task description (Art. 68 &amp;amp; 70) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Ensure more harmonization in an ‘unambiguous and unequivocal legal framework’ (p. 9) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 41em; "&gt; Directive becomes a regulation &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
