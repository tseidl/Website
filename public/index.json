These changes often have a peculiar double-dynamic.\nThe double-dynamic of digitalization First, they have a commodifying thrust, pushing economic logics ever deeper into the social fabric. Work is reorganized on digital platforms in ways that undermine existing (labor) regulations; individuals are nudged to disclose previously personal information such as health choices or reading habits as privacy increasingly comes at a cost; and new markets are created that subtly introduce opportunity cost considerations into people’s daily lives (do I lose money if I don’t sublet my spare room on Airbnb?).\nSecond, they have a disruptive thrust, radically altering the requirements for success, on the individual-, firm-, and national level. Relatively rapidly, skills become obsolete, markets disappear, competitive advantages vanish, and entirely new physical and social infrastructures become increasingly essential.\nVarieties of Digitalization The double-dynamic of digitalization confront policymakers with a whole range of challenges, from regulating platform companies, to protecting personal data, to responding to new skill and infrastructure demands. Importantly, policymakers often react very differently to these challenges, and these reactions change the nature of digitalization itself. This variance in policy responses and policy effects creates an El Dorado for social scientists trying to understand why and how digitalization varies, but also why and how capitalist societies differ.\nOn the one hand, the different trajectories digitalization takes in response to country-specific restrictions and affordances make a big difference in people´s economic, political and social lives. Consequently, technological change is not social destiny but depends on political choices (or non-choices) that can, in principle, be explained.\nOn the other hand, different reactions to similar challenges reveal something about the the political entities that make them. As the comparativist Peter Gourevitch once remarked: \u0026ldquo;For social scientists who enjoy comparisons, happiness is finding a force or event which affects a number of societies at the same time. Like test-tube solutions that respond differently to the same reagent, these societies reveal their characters in divergent responses to the same stimulus” 1.\nThe comparative political economy of digital capitalism Digitalization is such a reagent. The challenges it poses and the reactions it provokes open up a new field of research: the comparative political economy of digital capitalism. Drawing on the comparativist’s toolkit - developed in explaining earlier politico-economic transformations like globalization - much of my current work tries to explain when and why commodifying trends are reversed - for example by introducing ‘de-commodifying’ data protection or platform regulations; and to explain how disruptive changes are responded to - for example by investing in digital goods such as skills or R\u0026amp;D.\n  Gourevitch, P.

How, he wondered, can ideas become \u0026ldquo;effective forces in history?\u0026quot;1 How can things like beliefs or narratives, visions of the futures or conjurations of the past change the ways in which people act and interact?\nSocial scientists have long had a somewhat standoffish relationship with ideational explanations. During the cold war, the study of ideas sounded an awful lot like the study of ideology - an anathema for a new generation of self-confident social scientists who wanted to stay clear of the muddy waters of intellectual politics.2\nOthers believed that ideas are not explanatory variables in themselves but should be seen as “the product of circumstances and interests” or, at most, as “weapons framed for the furtherance of interests.\u0026quot;3 Yet others thought that ideas may well matter, but they are simply too hard to measure. Ideas, as Philip Converse famously quipped, are a \u0026ldquo;primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study.\u0026quot;4\nIt is, of course, rather curious “that scholars, whose entire existence is centered on the production and understanding of ideas, should grant ideas so little significance for explaining political life.”5 But not only that. Why, one wonders, would businesses and politician channel so many resources into something that does not actually matter? And why would ordinary people spend so much time and energy defending and attacking things that are supposed to be \u0026lsquo;epiphenomenal\u0026rsquo;?\n “The tens of millions of dollars that are spent on think tanks to churn out ideas and public relations firms to market them would be largely wasted. The billions of dollars spent on market research and on advertising would be unnecessary. (…) In politics, people would vote exclusively out of material self-interest. There would no longer be anything the matter with Kansas, and limousine liberals in Cambridge and Berkeley would become antitax crusaders. Job seekers would not choose careers because of their meaning; college students would stop trying to find themselves. Terrorists would not blow up buildings out of visions of religious glory or ideological triumph. There would be no such thing as a thought leader or a visionary.”6\n Ideas, it should be clear, do matter, and it comes as no surprise that ideational explanations have experienced something of a comeback in recent years and decades. In my own research I build on the theoretical and empirical work done by these \u0026lsquo;scholars of the ideational renaissance\u0026rsquo;, who have managed to move the field from the question: do ideas matter? to: how and when do they matter? And: how can they be measured?\nIn my own work, I explore how ideas can both change the ways in which actors perceive their own interests (and therefore their coalitional alignments), and how actors use ideas to advance their own interests by changing how others perceive theirs. But ideas, as the figure below illustrates, are not independent of the structural, ideational, and cultural context in which they operate. Rather actors’ interests are pre-shaped by their position in the political economy, and the power and plausibility of their interpretations of an always changing world depend on their fit with existing institutional regimes and other dominant ideas.\n  Ideas and Institutions     Weber, Max (2007): The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

Machine-readable texts have become widely available in recent years, and with them an impressive array of tools to make sense of them.\nThe uses and misuses of semantic violence Text as data approaches are characterized by a peculiar but instructive irony. As Kenneth Benoit observes,\n \u0026ldquo;generating insight from text as data is only possible once we have destroyed our ability to make sense of the texts directly. To make it useful as data, we had to obliterate the structure of the original text and turn its stylised and oversimplified features into a glorified spreadsheet that no reader can interpret directly, no matter how expert in linear algebra.1\u0026rdquo;\n The idea that to do certain useful things with texts, we need to subject them to a certain amount of \u0026lsquo;semantic violence\u0026rsquo; goes to the heart of current debates on treating text as data. Text as data approaches are highly and often surprisingly useful tools: tools for \u0026lsquo;reading\u0026rsquo; or summarizing large amounts of text; tools for augmenting human abilities or reproducing human efforts; tools for discovering and measuring latent traits. But they also come at a cost - a cost that is usually worth paying for but that also needs to be taken account of.\nInterestingly, the cost that has to be paid - but also the potential price - seems roughly proportional to the amount of semantic violence being done to the texts. On one hand of the spectrum, word counts or perhaps simple keyword extraction techniques are quite intuitive, and can be interpreted relatively straightforwardly. They are, however, also more limited when it comes to scaling complex analyses or discovering sophisticated concepts. Topic models or machine learning methods, on the other hand, are much less intuitive and require much more careful validation. They can, however, also produce more interesting results.\nFor me, awareness of such tradeoffs is a good starting point when thinking about how to do quantitative text analysis. Text as data approaches allows us to skip labor-intensive and often painful stages of the analysis, but they pose equally labor-intensive (and painful) challenges at other stages. While none of this is news, I periodically have to remind myself that treating text as data cannot and should not make my life as a researcher any easier - but, if done correctly, it can improve my research.\nFuture Avenues The field of text as data has seen such rapid progress in recent years that it becomes harder and harder to keep up. While I consider myself an informed consumer of the many methods and packages developed by this amazing community, I do have some thoughts on how to move things forward in the years to come.\n  One promising avenue that is increasingly taken is integrate various text as data methods. This can mean using natural language processing for pre-processing (e.g. selecting parts of speech based on theoretical considerations); mutually validating different approaches by using them in combinations (e.g. dictionary-based approaches to validate topic models or topic models to \u0026lsquo;inspire\u0026rsquo; dictionaries); or using different approaches to answer nested questions (e.g. text networks to identify coalitions and scaling approaches to map them onto a latent dimension).\n  Another angle, also increasingly used, is to combine text as data approaches with traditional methods, both quantitative and qualitative. This can mean using topic prevalence as a dependent or independent variable in regression models2; to use survey experiments to establish causal links between topics identified in newspapers and public opinion34; or to combine text as data methods with more interpretative approaches5, to give just a few examples.\n  A third approach is to think more systematically about the relationship between text as data approaches and social and political theory. This can mean methodologically reimagining important paradigms in the history of political thought6; exploring affinities between text as data approaches and theories of culture78; or using word embeddings to trace to test sociological theories about the cultural dimension of class.9\n  A last approach that I would like to mention is to use text as data methods in a comparative setting. This has become much easier with the availability of relatively cheap but very reliable translation tools, which - in a text as data context - have been shown to yield results comparable to gold-standard human translations.1011\n    Benoit, K.

There are two dimensions to this: the eclectic utilization of concepts and mechanisms from different theoretical traditions, and the combination of different empirical methods such that one method builds upon and validates the other.\nAnalytic Eclecticism Rudra Sil and Peter Katzenstein define analytic eclecticism as a\n \u0026ldquo;intellectual stance that supports efforts to complement, engage, and selectively utilize theoretical constructs embedded in contending research traditions to build complex arguments that bear on substantive problems of interest to both scholars and practitioners.1\u0026rdquo;\n This conception - which strongly resonates with me - assumes a healthy division of labor between two social scientific camps (individual researchers can belong to both camps, even at the same time): first, there are the \u0026lsquo;normal scientists\u0026rsquo; that work in established research paradigms which define their questions and push them towards ever more elaborated and nuanced theories and empirical results; second, there are the analytical eclecticists which, as it were, parasitically utilize the conceptual and empirical knowledge accumulated in the paradigmatic sciences to answer questions that are defined less by a research tradition than by practical concerns.\nIn other words, normal scientists ask questions that mainly make sense in light of certain theoretical paradigms. In doing so, they accumulate ever more detailed knowledge about how the social world works. Analytic eclecticists ask questions that immediately make sense for practitioners or lay people as well, and they provide answers by synthetically combining concepts, causal mechanisms, or even methods from competing theoretical paradigms.2\nNested Analysis Evan Lieberman has proposed nested analysis as a mixed-method strategy for comparative and historical analyses as a way to\n \u0026ldquo;assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies.34\u0026rdquo;\n This way of thinking about mixed method research remains highly relevant and serves as an encouragement to provide the best evidence available in order to answer a given question (which, alas, is often discouraged by the fast-moving realities of academic publishing). The methodological suggestions laid out in Lieberman\u0026rsquo;s articles provide a lodestar for the papers I would like to write but am not always able to.\n  Sil, R. and Katzenstein, P.J.

A while ago, I wrote a (somewhat turgid) chapter about my thinking on this topic, which hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much since. Unfortunately (and naturally), however, it is in German, so here is a quick summary of my thoughts.\nIn a nutshell, I find myself unconvinced by attempts to justify non-reductive forms of individualism.1 What do I mean by that? The central premise of non-reductive individualists is the emergentist claim that while social phenomena must always be realized in individuals (much like thoughts must always be somehow realized in brain activity), they are nonetheless irreducible to these underlying individual (or ultimately physical) processes in that they exert independent causal influences on them.\nWithout going into too much detail here, it strikes me as implausible that things that are always realized on a lower level can also be somehow independent of these lower levels (this is the same criticism that Jaegwon Kim2 has levelled against analogous arguments in the philosophy of mind). If everything always also has to happen on the lower level, there is simply nothing left to do for top-down causality. Either things happen on a higher level that don\u0026rsquo;t happen on a lower level, or there is no causal work left to do for higher-level processes.\nWithout going further down this rabbit hole, we find ourselves at an impasse. What seems obvious, namely that psychology or biology, not to speak of physics, don\u0026rsquo;t even come close to offering a reasonable explanation for the intricacies and eccentricities of social and political life, also seems philosophically questionable.\nThe problem is of course resolved if we acknowledge that the language game social scientists play offers incredibly useful shortcuts for describing processes that would be devilishly difficult to describe otherwise (it is, after all, also much easier to say \u0026ldquo;I am hungry\u0026rdquo; than to give an detailed account of the complex physiological processes that underlie both the feeling of hunger and its representation in the mind).\nBut if that is the case, why even bother with psychological or biological explanations? Why not just keep playing the social scientific language game if that gets us where we want to be? Well, it is not that easy either. That is because if we acknowledge that all social life is realized in individuals - that causality flows only between individuals and not from society \u0026ldquo;down\u0026rdquo; to individuals - we also need to acknowledge that our theories of social life should not contradict the best theories we have about individuals.\nBut fear not, fellow social scientists. In the pragmatist understanding I offer, the social sciences are not reduced to a biologistic or psychologistic science of the individual, but need only be compatible with their findings. This is not to say, of course, that social scientists cannot challenge these findings, but they should seriously engage with those that are well replicated and adjust their theories accordingly (for an excellent example, see Stephen Vaisey\u0026rsquo;s work on sociological theories of motivation and justification3).\nIt is in this spirit that I made the case for a more serious and sustained engagement between \u0026ldquo;human scientists\u0026rdquo; from different backgrounds. It heartening to see that multiple lines of research converge on similar conclusions, from the work on the social-evolutionary origins of human thinking and human morality4, to the work at the intersection of sociology and genetics5, to the \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; in many life sciences6, to the \u0026ldquo;psychological turn\u0026rdquo; in many subfields of political science.7\nI have no current projects in this area, but I am convinced that a full account of social life needs to take recourse to not only structural, institutional, and ideational explanations, but also to psychological (or biological) ones - sometimes this simply mean to make sure that our theories do not outrightly contradict \u0026ldquo;lower-level\u0026rdquo; theories, sometimes it means to actively incorporate (and advance) them.\n  Greve, J.

But they also produced a rich body of work at the intersection of social philosophy and empirical social science that I continue to feel drawn to.\nThe social philosophers of the Frankfurt School were among the first to insist on the connection between normative theorizing and empirical work. In looking at modern societies from this meta-theoretical vantage point, some of its members came to express an intuition that has always rung true to me: that despite its flaws, modernity (as an empirical phenomenon) is something (normatively) worth saving. Foremost among these thinkers is Jürgen Habermas. Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory of communicative action is an attempt to conceive of modernization as a deeply ambivalent process - a process that has released the search for truth, justice, and beauty from their traditional shackles while also untethering the capitalist from its societal bounds.1\nFor Habermas, the critic is called upon when the logic of systemic imperatives - the ruthless search for profit or the unjustified exercise of administrative power - distorts and subjugates the communicative logic of the lifeworld. It would mean doing injustice to the considerable sociological complexity of Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory to accuse him of empirical naivety. Habermas did of course not think that the lifeworld was free of power relations, even in the absence of encroaching systemic imperatives. But I always thought the major flaw in his theory was that it lacks a concept of \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;noumenal power\u0026rsquo;2 - of a power that affects the communicative taking and making of arguments itself, i.e., what people accept as \u0026lsquo;good reasons\u0026rsquo;.\nFoucault and the apotheosis of subversion This is problem is in a way the starting point for a second strand of social criticism. From Friedrich Nietzsche to Michel Foucault, these genealogical critics have attempt to drill holes in the solid concrete of the everyday lifeworld by asking its inhabitants to look in the mirror of their own, often dark and always contingent collective histories.3 The point of these genealogical critics, as Foucault readily acknowledges, is no longer to put criticism on normative foundation, but to elicit a \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;changes us, that prevents us from always being the same, or from having the same kind of relationship with things and others that we had before.\u0026quot;4 But this creates a problem: what is the point of eliciting such limit-experiences if there is no normative foundation from which to judge the relative quality of a given norm, practice, or social order? With no place left to stand on, the critic can only resort to celebrating the notion of subversion itself. Foucault says he does what he does so that those implicated in relations of power\n \u0026ldquo;might escape them through their actions of resistance and rebellion, might transform them in order not to be subjugated any longer. And if I don\u0026rsquo;t ever say what must be done, it isn\u0026rsquo;t because I believe that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be done; on the contrary, it is because I think that there are a thousand things to do, to invent, to forge, on the part of those who, recognizing the relations of power in which they\u0026rsquo;re implicated, have decided to resist or escape them. From this point of view all of my investigations rest on a postulate of absolute optimism. I do not conduct my analyses in order to say: this is how things are, look how trapped you are. I say certain things only to the extent to which I see them as capable of permitting the transformation of reality.\u0026quot;3\n But why subversion - and the \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; it elicits - is better than compliance is not - and cannot be - answered. If everything solid melts into air, we can only hope to land softly.\nBourdieu and the freedom in determinism A third strand of social criticism, most eloquently developed by Pierre Bourdieu, has maneuvered itself into a similar cul-de-sac. For Bourdieu, social criticism is deeply entangled with questions of social determinism. In his sociological work, he had demonstrated the structuring effects of social fields and social power. For Bourdieu, communicative action was always distorted by the pernicious logic of symbolic power - the power that makes the dominated accept and internalize the reasons for their domination.\nBut for Bourdieu there was a way out, at least sort of. For Bourdieu, and here he agreed with Foucault, there was no going back behind the knowledge and acknowledgment of our own historicity - the fact that who we are and what we believe, as individuals and societies, is profoundly shaped by social and historical forces. But this, Bourdieu insisted, does not mean abandoning the possibility of criticism but rather radicalizing it by asking about the social conditions of its possibility.\n \u0026ldquo;In short, it is only through recognizing one\u0026rsquo;s historicity that it becomes possible for Reason to extricate itself from it\u0026rdquo;5\n What Bourdieu means here is that we can only think of escaping our historicity - the ways in which history and society shape us - if we understand and acknowledge it, much like we could only build airplanes after we understood and acknowledged the laws of gravity. Freedom, then, does not disappear in the face of determinism but requires us to recognize it. But, Bourdieu realizes, our ability to uncover the laws that govern social life is itself a product of history.\n \u0026ldquo;I tend to pose the question regarding reason, or norms in a radically historical way. My initial question would be: in whose interest is universalism? or what are the social conditions in which certain actors come to be interested in it? (\u0026hellip;) This historicism has to be pushed to its limits through radical doubt in order to see what can still be saved 6\u0026rdquo;\n For Bourdieu, science itself is the product of contingent (and reversible) historical circumstances that have established a situation in which all actors have an interest in finding the truth - as opposed to politically convenient, economically lucrative, or morally comfortable lies. This is why science is so important; it carves out a socially constructed space for people to pursue the truth - and to get something out of it. Only under these conditions - however imperfect they may be - can we hope to understand and therefore at least somewhat escape - the iron laws of determinism.\nThe social critic as a gardener It is here that my thinking on social criticism has arrived - at least for the moment. We, as (social) scientists are the privileged children of modernity which has put us in a position to be able to play a game in which we can win by pursuing the truth, at least in principle. And in doing so, we can provide individuals and societies with the knowledge to understand and accept their own complicity in historically grown and socially structured power relations. And it is this knowledge that they need to make - in acts of communicative interaction - decisions about their individual and collective fate that have at least the semblance of freedom. For me, then, the job of the social critic is much like the job of the gardener: to remove the weed of false freedom - freedom ignorant of its determination - in order to give the delicate flower of true freedom - freedom educated about its own determination - a chance to blossom.\n  Habermas, J.

It is this later phenomenon, the essential and continuing moral contestedness of capitalism, and the pervasiveness of (stymied) moral impulses in capitalist life that have aroused my interest in the moral embeddedness of economic action.\nThe Spirit of Capitalism In my empirical work, I have used the concept of the spirit of capitalism to make sense of the ways in which normative ideas motivate, legitimize, and orient the actions of capitalist actors. Drawing on a long tradition of scholarship that ranges from Sombart to Weber to Boltanski and Chiapello, I have tried to think more empirically about both, the overt strategic uses of morality, and the more subtle ways in which moral ideas influence strategic calculations.\nYou can read more about my thinking on the capitalist spirit in my paper(s) on the spirit of capitalism; and you can read more about my thinking about the relationship between capitalism and morality in my (overly lengthy and learned) master thesis, which you can download here.\n","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"69c4edd7eadfedce581aa8dce9ce7e85","permalink":"/projects/moral-embeddness-of-economic-action/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/moral-embeddness-of-economic-action/","section":"projects","summary":"Which role does morality play in economic life?","tags":["Theoretical"],"title":"The Moral Embeddedness of Economic Action","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As an undergraduate, I became quite interested in the drivers of Germany\u0026rsquo;s foreign policy. And while I no longer actively pursue this question, some of the underlying concerns remain very close to my heart.\nState identities In particular, I remain fascinated by what constitutes and defines a state\u0026rsquo;s identity. In my own work, I found surprisingly deep ideational and organizational continuities in German foreign policy – continuities that out-lived partisan changes. I also found that ideas - from a default ordoliberal view of the economy, to a vaguely felt obligation to the German national interest, to the widely shared believe that Germany is, by and large, a force for good in the world - to be important drivers of foreign policy decisions.\nIn more recent work, I take up this question of state identity in the context of economic and fiscal policymaking. How, for example, does the way states understand themselves and their role in the economy influence their spending decisions?1 How do their views on the virtues of debt shape their views of the relative merits of savings and investments?2\nThe geopolitics of political economy Another way in which my thinking on German foreign policy continues to inform my current work is by making me take the geopolitical dimension of politico-economic phenomena seriously. Especially in a world of \u0026lsquo;weaponized interdependence\u0026rsquo;3, geopolitics and the politics of economic and public policymaking are inextricably intertwined. Geopolitical concerns are crucial for innovation and innovation policy4; questions of internet governance are increasingly complicated by the geopolitical competition between different visions and versions of the internet; and, as I showed in my own work on Germany\u0026rsquo;s response to the euro crisis, seemingly economic decisions are in fact motivated by geopolitical ambitions as much as by economic interests.\n  Mazzucato, M.
