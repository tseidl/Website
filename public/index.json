How, he wondered, can ideas become \u0026ldquo;effective forces in history?\u0026quot;1 How can things like beliefs or narratives, visions of the futures or conjurations of the past change the ways in which people act and interact?\nSocial scientists have long had a somewhat standoffish relationship with ideational explanations. During the cold war, the study of ideas sounded an awful lot like the study of ideology - an anathema for a new generation of self-confident social scientists who wanted to stay clear of the muddy waters of intellectual politics.2\nOthers believed that ideas are not explanatory variables in themselves but should be seen as “the product of circumstances and interests” or, at most, as “weapons framed for the furtherance of interests.\u0026quot;3 Yet others thought that ideas may well matter, but they are simply too hard to measure. Ideas, as Philip Converse famously quipped, are a \u0026ldquo;primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study.\u0026quot;4\nIt is, of course, rather curious “that scholars, whose entire existence is centered on the production and understanding of ideas, should grant ideas so little significance for explaining political life.”5 But not only that. Why, one wonders, would businesses and politician channel all these resources into something that does not actually matter? And why would ordinary people spend so much time and energy defending and attacking things that are supposed to be \u0026lsquo;epiphenomenal\u0026rsquo;?\n “The tens of millions of dollars that are spent on think tanks to churn out ideas and public relations fi rms to market them would be largely wasted. The billions of dollars spent on market research and on advertising would be unnecessary. (…) In politics, people would vote exclusively out of material self-interest. There would no longer be anything the matter with Kansas, and limousine liberals in Cambridge and Berkeley would become antitax crusaders. Job seekers would not choose careers because of their meaning; college students would stop trying to find themselves. Terrorists would not blow up buildings out of visions of religious glory or ideological triumph. There would be no such thing as a thought leader or a visionary.”6\n Ideas, it should be clear, do matter, and it comes as no surprise that ideational explanations of have experienced something of a comeback in recent years and decades. In my own research I build on the theoretical and empirical work done by these \u0026lsquo;scholars of the ideational renaissance\u0026rsquo;, who have managed to move the field from the question: do ideas matter? to: how and when do they matter? And: how can they be measured?\nIt is clear that the arm of criticism cannot replace the criticism of arms. Material force can only be overthrown by material force, but theory itself becomes a material force when it has seized the masses.\n  Ideas and Institutions   affect the ways institutions are build or attacked, the ways in which people understand their own interests, and the ways in which the political processes in and through which digitalization is \u0026ndash; or is not \u0026ndash; regulated. Ideas, however, are not treated in isolation from institutional or structural factors. Rather, I look at the ways in which self-interested actors use ideas to advance their interests, how ideas become embedded in institutions, how ideas instantiate underlying economic and institutional logics, or how ideas change the ways in which actors perceive and conceive of digitalization.\n  Weber, Max (2007): The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

A while ago, I wrote a whole (and somewhat turgid) chapter about my thinking on this topic, which hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much since. Unfortunately (and naturally), however, the chapter is in German, so here is a quick summary of my thoughts.\nIn a nutshell, I find myself unconvinced by attempts to justify non-reductive forms of individualism.1 What do I mean by that? The central premise of non-reductive indidvidualists is the emergentist claim that while social phenomena must always be realized in individuals (much like thoughts must always be somehow realized in brain activity), they are nonetheless irreducible to these underlying individual (or ultimately physial) processes in that they exert independent causal influences on them.\nWithout going into too much detail here, it strikes me as implausible that things that are always realized on a lower level can also be somehow independent of these lower levels (this is the same criticism that Jaegwon Kim2 has levelled against analogous arguments in the philosophy of mind). If everything always also has to happen on the lower level, there is simply nothing left to do for top-down causality. Either things happen on a higher level that don\u0026rsquo;t happen on a lower level, or there is just no causal work left to do for higher-level processes.\nWithout going further down this rabbit hole, we find ourselves at an impasse. What seems obvious, namely that psychology or biology, not to speak of physics, don\u0026rsquo;t even come close to offering a reasonable explanation for the intricacies and excentricities of social and political life, also seems philosophically questionable.\nThe problem is of course resolved if we acknowledge that the language game social scientists are playing offers incredibly useful shortcuts for describing processes that would be devilishly difficult to describe otherwise (it is, after all, also much easier to say \u0026ldquo;I am hungry\u0026rdquo; than to give an detailed account of the complex physiological processes that underlie both the feeling of hunger and its representation in the mind).\nBut if that is the case, why even bother with psychological or biological explanations? Why not just keep playing the social scientific language game if that gets us where we want to be? Well, it is not that easy either. That is because if we acknowledge that all social life is realized in individuals - that causality flows only between individuals and not from society \u0026ldquo;down\u0026rdquo; to individuals - we also need to acknowledge that our theories of social life should not contradict the best theories we have about individuals.\nBut fear now, fellow social scientists. In the pragmatist understanding I and many others offer, the social sciences are not reduced to a biologistic or psychologistic science of the individual, but need only be compatible with their findings. This is not to say, of course, that social scientists cannot challenge these findings, but they should seriously engage with those that are well replicated and adjust their theories accordingly (for an excellent example, see Stephen Vaisey\u0026rsquo;s work on sociological theories of motivation and justification3).\nIt is in this spirit that I made the case for a more serious and sustained engagement between \u0026ldquo;human scientists\u0026rdquo; from different backgrounds. It heartening to see that multiple lines of research converge on similiar conclusions, from the work on the social-evolutionary origins of human thinking and human morality4, to the work at the intersection of sociology and genetics5, to the \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; in many life sciences6, to the \u0026ldquo;psychological turn\u0026rdquo; in many subfields of political science.7\nI have no current projects in this area, but I am convinced that a full account of social life needs to take recourse to not only structural, institutional, and ideational explanations, but also to psychological (or biological) ones - sometimes this simply mean to make sure that our theories do not outrightly contradict \u0026ldquo;lower-level\u0026rdquo; theories, sometimes it means to actively incorporate (and advance) them.\n  Greve, J.

But they also produced a rich body of work at the intersection of social philosophy and empirical social science that I continue to feel drawn to.\nThe social philosophers of the Frankfurt School were among the first to insist on the connection between normative theorizing and empirical work. In looking at modern societies from this meta-theoretical vantage point, some of its members came to express an intuition that has always rung true to me: that despite its flaws, modernity is something worth saving. Foremost among these thinkers was Jürgen Habermas. Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory of communicative action is an attempt to conceive of modernization as a deeply ambivalent process - a process that has released the search for truth, justice, and beauty from their traditional shackles while also untethering the capitalist from its societal bounds.1\nFor Habermas, the critic is called upon when the logic of systemic imperatives - the ruthless search for profit or the unjustified exercise of administrative power - distorts and subjugates the communicative logic of the lifeworld. It would mean doing injustice to the considerable sociological complexity of Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory to accuse him of empirical naivety. Habermas did of course not think that the lifeworld was without power relations of its own, even in the absence of encroaching systemic imperatives. But it is true that his theory lacks a concept of \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;noumenal power\u0026rsquo;2 - of a power that affects the communicative taking and making of arguments themselves, that affects what people accept as \u0026lsquo;good reasons\u0026rsquo; and what not.\nFoucault and the apotheosis of subversion This is precisely the starting point for a second strand of social criticism. From Friedrich Nietzsche to Michel Foucault, these genealogical critics have attempt to drill holes in the solid concrete of the everyday lifeworld by asking its inhabitants to look in the mirror of our own, often dark and always contingent collective histories.3 The point of these genealogical critics, as Foucault readily acknowledges, is no longer to put criticism on normative foundation, but to elicit a \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;changes us, that prevents us from always being the same, or from having the same kind of relationship with things and others that we had before.\u0026quot;4\nBut what is the point of eliciting such limit-experiences if there is no normative foundation from which to judge the relative quality of a given norm, practice, or social order. With no place left to stand on, the critic can only resort to celebrating the notion of subversion itself. Foucault says he does what he does so that those implicated in relations of power\n \u0026ldquo;might escape them through their actions of resistance and rebellion, might transform them in order not to be subjugated any longer. And if I don\u0026rsquo;t ever say what must be done, it isn\u0026rsquo;t because I believe that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be done; on the contrary, it is because I think that there are a thousand things to do, to invent, to forge, on the part of those who, recognizing the relations of power in which they\u0026rsquo;re implicated, have decided to resist or escape them. From this point of view all of my investigations rest on a postulate of absolute optimism. I do not conduct my analyses in order to say: this is how things are, look how trapped you are. I say certain things only to the extent to which I see them as capable of permitting the transformation of reality.\u0026quot;3\n But why subversion - and the \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; it elicits - is better than the compliance or even respect is not - and cannot be - answered. If everything solid has melted into air, we can only hope that we land softly.\nBourdieu and the freedom in determinism A third strand of social criticism, most eloquently developed by Pierre Bourdieu, has maneuvered itself into a similar cul-de-sac. For Bourdieu, social criticism is deeply entangled with questions of social determinism. In his sociological work, he had amply demonstrated the structuring effects of social fields and social power. For Bourdieu, communicative action was always distorted by the pernicious logic of symbolic power - the power that makes the dominated accept and internalize the reasons for their domination.\nBut for Bourdieu there was a way out, at least sort of. For Bourdieu, and here he agreed with Foucault, there was no going back behind the knowledge and acknowledgment of our own historicity - the fact that who we are and what we believe, as individuals and societies, is profoundly shaped by social and historical forces. But this, Bourdieu insisted, does not mean abandoning the possibility of critic but rather radicalizing it by asking about the social conditions of its possibility.\n \u0026ldquo;In short, it is only through recognizing one\u0026rsquo;s historicity that it becomes possible for Reason to extricate itself from it [its historicity]\u0026quot;5\n What Bourdieu means here is that we can only think of escaping our historicity - the ways in which history and society shape us - if we understand and acknowledged it, much like we could only build flying airplanes after we understood and acknowledged the laws of gravity. Freedom, then, does not disappear in the face of determinism but requires us to recognize it. But our ability to uncover the laws that govern social life is of course itself a product of history.\n \u0026ldquo;I tend to pose the question regarding reason, or norms in a radically historical way. My initial question would be: in whose interest is universalism? or what are the social conditions in which certain actors come to be interested in it? (\u0026hellip;) This historicism has to be pushed to its limits through radical doubt in order to see what can still be saved 6\u0026rdquo;\n For Bourdieu, science itself is the product of contingent (and reversible) historical circumstances that have established a situation in which all actors have an interest in finding the truth - as opposed to politically convenient, economically lucrative, or morally comfortable lies. This is why science is so important; it carves out a socially constructed space for people to pursue truth - and to get something from doing so. Only under these conditions - however imperfect they may be - can we hope to understand and therefore at least somewhat escape - the iron laws of determinism.\nThe social critic as a gardener It is here that my thinking on social criticism has arrived - at least for the moment. We, as (social) scientists are in the extraordinarily privileged position to be able to play a game in which we can win by pursuing the truth, at least in principle. And in doing so, we can provide individuals and societies with the knowledge to understand and accept their own complicity in historically grown and socially structured power relations. And it is this knowledge that they need to make decisions about their individual and collective fate that have at least the semblance of freedom. For me, then, the job of the social critic is much like the job of the gardener: to remove the weed of false freedom - freedom ignorant of its determination - in order to give the delicate flower of true freedom - freedom educated about its own determination - a chance to blossom.\n  Habermas, J.

You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Math Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_0^*) = \\begin{cases} p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\n1-p_0^* \u0026amp; \\text {if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
