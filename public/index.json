A while ago, I wrote a whole (and somewhat turgid) chapter about my thinking on this topic, which hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much since. Unfortunately (and naturally), however, the chapter is in German, so here is a quick summary of my thoughts.\nIn a nutshell, I find myself unconvinced by attempts to justify non-reductive forms of individualism.1 What do I mean by that? The central premise of non-reductive indidvidualists is the emergentist claim that while social phenomena must always be realized in individuals (much like thoughts must always be somehow realized in brain activity), they are nonetheless irreducible to these underlying individual (or ultimately physial) processes in that they exert independent causal influences on them.\nWithout going into too much detail here, it strikes me as implausible that things that are always realized on a lower level can also be somehow independent of these lower levels (this is the same criticism that Jaegwon Kim2 has levelled against analogous arguments in the philosophy of mind). If everything always also has to happen on the lower level, there is simply nothing left to do for top-down causality. Either things happen on a higher level that don\u0026rsquo;t happen on a lower level, or there is just no causal work left to do for higher-level processes.\nWithout going further down this rabbit hole, we find ourselves at an impasse. What seems obvious, namely that psychology or biology, not to speak of physics, don\u0026rsquo;t even come close to offering a reasonable explanation for the intricacies and excentricities of social and political life, also seems philosophically questionable.\nThe problem is of course resolved if we acknowledge that the language game social scientists are playing offers incredibly useful shortcuts for describing processes that would be devilishly difficult to describe otherwise (it is, after all, also much easier to say \u0026ldquo;I am hungry\u0026rdquo; than to give an detailed account of the complex physiological processes that underlie both the feeling of hunger and its representation in the mind).\nBut if that is the case, why even bother with psychological or biological explanations? Why not just keep playing the social scientific language game if that gets us where we want to be? Well, it is not that easy either. That is because if we acknowledge that all social life is realized in individuals - that causality flows only between individuals and not from society \u0026ldquo;down\u0026rdquo; to individuals - we also need to acknowledge that our theories of social life should not contradict the best theories we have about individuals.\nBut fear now, fellow social scientists. In the pragmatist understanding I and many others offer, the social sciences are not reduced to a biologistic or psychologistic science of the individual, but need only be compatible with their findings. This is not to say, of course, that social scientists cannot challenge these findings, but they should seriously engage with those that are well replicated and adjust their theories accordingly (for an excellent example, see Stephen Vaisey\u0026rsquo;s work on sociological theories of motivation and justification3).\nIt is in this spirit that I made the case for a more serious and sustained engagement between \u0026ldquo;human scientists\u0026rdquo; from different backgrounds. It heartening to see that multiple lines of research converge on similiar conclusions, from the work on the social-evolutionary origins of human thinking and human morality4, to the work at the intersection of sociology and genetics5, to the \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; in many life sciences6, to the \u0026ldquo;psychological turn\u0026rdquo; in many subfields of political science.7\nI have no current projects in this area, but I am convinced that a full account of social life needs to take recourse to not only structural, institutional, and ideational explanations, but also to psychological (or biological) ones - sometimes this simply mean to make sure that our theories do not outrightly contradict \u0026ldquo;lower-level\u0026rdquo; theories, sometimes it means to actively incorporate (and advance) them.\n  Greve, J.

How, he wondered, can ideas become \u0026ldquo;effective forces in history?\u0026quot;1 How can things like frames and narratives, worldviews and belief systems, visions of the futures and conjurations of the past change the ways in which people act and interact?\nFor a long time, many social scientists have had a somewhat standoffish relationship with ideational explanations. During the cold war, the study of ideas sounded an awful lot like the study of ideology - an anathema for a new generation of self-confident social scientists who wanted to stay clear of the muddy waters of intellectual politics.2 Many of them believed that ideas were not really explanatory variables in themselves but should be seen as “the product of circumstances and interests” or, at most, as “weapons framed for the furtherance of interests.\u0026quot;3\nOthers thought that ideas may well matter, but that they were simply too hard to measure. Ideas, as Philip Converse famously quipped, are a \u0026ldquo;primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study.\u0026quot;4\nIt is, of course, rather curious “that scholars, whose entire existence is centered on the production and understanding of ideas, should grant ideas so little significance for explaining political life.”5 But not only that. Why, one wonders, would businesses and politician waste billions on spin doctors and PR wizards if ideas did not actually matter? And why would ordinary people spend so much time and energy defending and attacking things that are in fact \u0026lsquo;epiphenomenal\u0026rsquo;?\n “The tens of millions of dollars that are spent on think tanks to churn out ideas and public relations firms to market them would be largely wasted. The billions of dollars spent on market research and on advertising would be unnecessary. (…) In politics, people would vote exclusively out of material self-interest. There would no longer be anything the matter with Kansas, and limousine liberals in Cambridge and Berkeley would become antitax crusaders. Job seekers would not choose careers because of their meaning; college students would stop trying to find themselves. Terrorists would not blow up buildings out of visions of religious glory or ideological triumph. There would be no such thing as a thought leader or a visionary.”6\n Ideas, it should be clear, do matter, and it comes as no surprise that ideational explanations have experienced something of a comeback since the 1990s. In my own research I try to build on and advance the theoretical and empirical work done by the scholars that have ushered in this ideational renaissance. Thanks to them, we no longer have to defend the claim that ideas matter but can focus on the much more interesting questions of how and when they matter, and how they can be measured?\nBoth theoretically and empirically, ideational scholarship has come a long way.\n  First, we now have the conceptual tools to clearly distinguish between ideas of different levels of generality: from something as general as economic cultures7 to programmatic beliefs that translate between abstract Weltanschauungen and concrete policy positions8 to something as - literally - hands-on as the Lafer curved sketched on a napkin (depicted on the image above).9\n  Second, we also have a much better understanding of how different cogntive and normative ideas interact with human psychology, for example as frames10 or mental models.11 I have more to say about this here.\n  Third, we now a much richer set of both qualitative and quantitative tools to trace the effects of ideas12 or identify them in a variety of unsupervised and supervised ways (something that I have more to say about here and here here).\n  Finally, we have a much better grasp of what ideas can do and what can be done with them. On the one hand, scholars have made great strides in thinking about the causal paths through which ideas become \u0026lsquo;effective forces in history\u0026rsquo;. Uncertainty, in particular, has been identified as the crucial causal wedge that gives ideas an entry point into social life.13 On the other hand, much progress has been made in sketching out how the causal effects of ideas are conditioned by the material and institutional structures in which actors operate.\n  The figure below summarizes much of my current thinking on ideas and politics. The way I see it, a focus on ideas can both illuminate how actors perceive their own interests, and, conversly, how actors use ideas to advanced their interests by manipulating how others perceive theirs. However, ideas don\u0026rsquo;t operate in a vacuum. Their viability and sucess depend on whether they find the support of powerful groups, whether they align with existing institutions, or whether they make sense in light of other, dominant ideas.\n  What is important here is that ideational explanations are not meant to replace structural or institutional ones; rather, they are meant to provide more rounded accounts of agency within structural and institutional settings.14 They are meant to show how actors perceptions of their own interests is not just shaped by their structural or institutional position, but also by the things they happen to believe in. Likewise, actors engage in ideational politics to change how other actors perceive the world around them (\u0026lsquo;worldview politics\u0026rsquo;) as well as their role in it (\u0026lsquo;identity politics\u0026rsquo;).15\nIt is this mutual or, if you want, dialektical relationship that I try to investigate empirically. For example, in my paper on the regulation of Uber in New York, I use discourse network analysis to show how ideas can both serve as \u0026ldquo;coalition magnets\u0026rdquo; for building alliances of strange bedfellows, and as coalitional wedges that can drive natural allies apart. In other work, such as in my comparative paper on digitalization discourses, I focus more on the ways in which structural, institutional, and cultural contexts shape the ways in which digitalization is framed and fought over.\nThe point is not to prioritize one approach over another, but to use the toolbox of modern ideational analysis to make sense of a world in which ideas are not only as \u0026ldquo;important to study\u0026rdquo; as ever - but can in fact be studied in ways that are both rigorous and do justice to the richness of political life.\n  Weber, Max (2007) The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

But they also produced a rich body of work at the intersection of social philsophpy and empirical social science that I continue to feel drawn to, and that is, perhaps, the saving grace of the Frankfurt School, which has first developed but not always lived up to promise of this interdisciplinary approach.\nIn addition, many of the thinkers of the Frankfurt School, above all Jürgen Habermas, expressed an intution that has always rung true to me: that despite its flaws, modernity is something worth saving. Habermas own theory is an attempt to show how the process of moderization has released the rationality potential embedded in human language. This same process of modernization, however, now threatens to undermine the progress it has made possible as an unteethered capitalist system wreaks havoc on the very lifeworlds from where it once emerged.1\nThe French and the search for a way out This approach to social criticism is of course not the only one possible. From Friedrich Nietzsche to Michel Foucault, there is a long history of genealogical critics, which attempt to drill holes in the solid concrete of taken-for-granted lifeworlds by forcing societies to look into the mirror of their own, often dark and always contingent histories.2 The point of these genealogical critics, as Foucault readily acknowledges, is no longer to put criticism on normative foundation, but to elicit a \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;changes us, that prevents us from always being the same, or from having the same kind of relationoship with things and others that we had before.\u0026quot;3\nThis, of course, leads to a point where everything solid melts into air, as Marx once put it, even the purpuose of the genealogical critcism itself. Foucault says he does what he does so that those implicated in relations of power\n \u0026ldquo;might escape them through their actions of resistance and rebellion, might transform them in order not to be subjugated any longer. And if I don\u0026rsquo;t ever say what must be done, it isn\u0026rsquo;t because I believe that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be done; on the contrary, it is because I think that there are a thousand things to do, to invent, to forge, on the part of those who, recognizing the relations of power in which they\u0026rsquo;re implicated, have decided to resist or escape them. From this point of view all of my investigations rest on a postulate of absolute optimism. I do not conduct my analyses in order to say: this is how things are, look how trapped you are. I say certain things only to the extent to which I see them as capable of permitting the transformation of reality.\u0026quot;3\n Foucault, then, does not want to be the one who criticizes but hopes that his genealogical descriptions might elicit rebellion in the reader. Why rebellion is better than non-rebellion, why replacing one system of power with another, is a question that Foucault does not have an answer for.\nI always found this position frustrating, thought that we could \u0026lsquo;do better\u0026rsquo;, not just by developing standards that are at least better justifiable.\nIn a similar yet different fashion, Pierre Bourdieu has offered a\n  Habermas, J.
