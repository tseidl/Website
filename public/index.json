These changes often have a peculiar double-dynamic.\nThe double-dynamic of digitalization First, they have a commodifying thrust, pushing economic logics ever deeper into the social fabric. Work is reorganized on digital platforms in ways that undermine existing (labor) regulations; individuals are nudged to disclose previously personal information such as health choices or reading habits as privacy increasingly comes at a cost; and new markets are created that subtly introduce opportunity cost considerations into people’s daily lives (do I lose money if I don’t sublet my spare room on Airbnb?).\nSecond, they have a disruptive thrust, radically altering the requirements for success, on the individual-, firm-, and national level. Relatively rapidly, skills become obsolete, markets disappear, competitive advantages vanish, and entirely new physical and social infrastructures become increasingly essential.\nVarieties of Digitalization The double-dynamic of digitalization confront policymakers with a whole range of challenges, from regulating platform companies, to protecting personal data, to responding to new skill and infrastructure demands. Importantly, policymakers often react very differently to these challenges, and these reactions change the nature of digitalization itself. This variance in policy responses and policy effects creates an El Dorado for social scientists trying to understand why and how digitalization varies, but also why and how capitalist societies differ.\nOn the one hand, the different trajectories digitalization takes in response to country-specific restrictions and affordances make a big difference in people´s economic, political and social lives. Consequently, technological change is not social destiny but depends on political choices (or non-choices) that can, in principle, be explained.\nOn the other hand, different reactions to similar challenges reveal something about the the political entities that make them. As the comparativist Peter Gourevitch once remarked: \u0026ldquo;For social scientists who enjoy comparisons, happiness is finding a force or event which affects a number of societies at the same time. Like test-tube solutions that respond differently to the same reagent, these societies reveal their characters in divergent responses to the same stimulus” 1.\nThe comparative political economy of digital capitalism Digitalization is such a reagent. The challenges it poses and the reactions it provokes open up a new field of research: the comparative political economy of digital capitalism. Drawing on the comparativist’s toolkit - developed in explaining earlier politico-economic transformations like globalization - much of my current work tries to explain when and why commodifying trends are reversed - for example by introducing ‘de-commodifying’ data protection or platform regulations; and to explain how disruptive changes are responded to - for example by investing in digital goods such as skills or R\u0026amp;D.\n  Gourevitch, P.

How, he wondered, can ideas become \u0026ldquo;effective forces in history?\u0026quot;1 How can things like beliefs or narratives, visions of the futures or conjurations of the past change the ways in which people act and interact?\nSocial scientists have long had a somewhat standoffish relationship with ideational explanations. During the cold war, the study of ideas sounded an awful lot like the study of ideology - an anathema for a new generation of self-confident social scientists who wanted to stay clear of the muddy waters of intellectual politics.2\nOthers believed that ideas are not explanatory variables in themselves but should be seen as “the product of circumstances and interests” or, at most, as “weapons framed for the furtherance of interests.\u0026quot;3 Yet others thought that ideas may well matter, but they are simply too hard to measure. Ideas, as Philip Converse famously quipped, are a \u0026ldquo;primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study.\u0026quot;4\nIt is, of course, rather curious “that scholars, whose entire existence is centered on the production and understanding of ideas, should grant ideas so little significance for explaining political life.”5 But not only that. Why, one wonders, would businesses and politician channel so many resources into something that does not actually matter? And why would ordinary people spend so much time and energy defending and attacking things that are supposed to be \u0026lsquo;epiphenomenal\u0026rsquo;?\n “The tens of millions of dollars that are spent on think tanks to churn out ideas and public relations firms to market them would be largely wasted. The billions of dollars spent on market research and on advertising would be unnecessary. (…) In politics, people would vote exclusively out of material self-interest. There would no longer be anything the matter with Kansas, and limousine liberals in Cambridge and Berkeley would become antitax crusaders. Job seekers would not choose careers because of their meaning; college students would stop trying to find themselves. Terrorists would not blow up buildings out of visions of religious glory or ideological triumph. There would be no such thing as a thought leader or a visionary.”6\n Ideas, it should be clear, do matter, and it comes as no surprise that ideational explanations have experienced something of a comeback in recent years and decades. In my own research I build on the theoretical and empirical work done by these \u0026lsquo;scholars of the ideational renaissance\u0026rsquo;, who have managed to move the field from the question: do ideas matter? to: how and when do they matter? And: how can they be measured?\nIn my own work, I explore how ideas can both change the ways in which actors perceive their own interests (and therefore their coalitional alignments), and how actors use ideas to advance their own interests by changing how others perceive theirs. But ideas, as the figure below illustrates, are not independent of the structural, ideational, and cultural context in which they operate. Rather actors’ interests are pre-shaped by their position in the political economy, and the power and plausibility of their interpretations of an always changing world depend on their fit with existing institutional regimes and other dominant ideas.\n  Ideas and Institutions     Weber, Max (2007): The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.

Machine-readable texts have become widely available in recent years, and with them an impressive array of tools to make sense of them.\nThe uses and misuses of semantic violence Text as data approaches are characterized by a peculiar but instructive irony. As Kenneth Benoit observes,\n \u0026ldquo;generating insight from text as data is only possible once we have destroyed our ability to make sense of the texts directly. To make it useful as data, we had to obliterate the structure of the original text and turn its stylised and oversimplified features into a glorified spreadsheet that no reader can interpret directly, no matter how expert in linear algebra.1\u0026rdquo;\n The idea that to do certain useful things with texts, we need to subject them to a certain amount of \u0026lsquo;semantic violence\u0026rsquo; goes to the heart of current debates on treating text as data. Text as data approaches are highly and often surprisingly useful tools: tools for \u0026lsquo;reading\u0026rsquo; or summarizing large amounts of text; tools for augmenting human abilities or reproducing human efforts; tools for discovering and measuring latent traits. But they also come at a cost - a cost that is usually worth paying for but that also needs to be taken account of.\nInterestingly, the cost that has to be paid - but also the potential price - seems roughly proportional to the amount of semantic violence being done to the texts. On one hand of the spectrum, word counts or perhaps simple keyword extraction techniques are quite intuitive, and can be interpreted relatively straightforwardly. They are, however, also more limited when it comes to scaling complex analyses or discovering sophisticated concepts. Topic models or machine learning methods, on the other hand, are much less intuitive and require much more careful validation. They can, however, also produce more interesting results.\nFor me, awareness of such tradeoffs is a good starting point when thinking about how to do quantitative text analysis. Text as data approaches allows us to skip labor-intensive and often painful stages of the analysis, but they pose equally labor-intensive (and painful) challenges at other stages. While none of this is news, I periodically have to remind myself that treating text as data cannot and should not make my life as a researcher any easier - but, if done correctly, it can improve my research.\nFuture Avenues The field of text as data has seen such rapid progress in recent years that it becomes harder and harder to keep up. While I consider myself an informed consumer of the many methods and packages developed by this amazing community, I do have some thoughts on how to move things forward in the years to come.\n  One promising avenue that is increasingly taken is integrate various text as data methods. This can mean using natural language processing for pre-processing (e.g. selecting parts of speech based on theoretical considerations); mutually validating different approaches by using them in combinations (e.g. dictionary-based approaches to validate topic models or topic models to \u0026lsquo;inspire\u0026rsquo; dictionaries); or using different approaches to answer nested questions (e.g. text networks to identify coalitions and scaling approaches to map them onto a latent dimension).\n  Another angle, also increasingly used, is to combine text as data approaches with traditional methods, both quantitative and qualitative. This can mean using topic prevalence as a dependent or independent variable in regression models2; to use survey experiments to establish causal links between topics identified in newspapers and public opinion34; or to combine text as data methods with more interpretative approaches5, to give just a few examples.\n  A third approach is to think more systematically about the relationship between text as data approaches and social and political theory. This can mean methodologically reimagining important paradigms in the history of political thought6; exploring affinities between text as data approaches and theories of culture78; or using word embeddings to trace to test sociological theories about the cultural dimension of class.9\n  A last approach that I would like to mention is to use text as data methods in a comparative setting. This has become much easier with the availability of relatively cheap but very reliable translation tools, which - in a text as data context - have been shown to yield results comparable to gold-standard human translations.1011\n    Benoit, K.

There are two dimensions to this: the eclectic utilization of concepts and mechanisms from different theoretical traditions, and the combination of different empirical methods such that one method builds upon and validates the other.\nAnalytic Eclecticism Rudra Sil and Peter Katzenstein define analytic eclecticism as a\n \u0026ldquo;intellectual stance that supports efforts to complement, engage, and selectively utilize theoretical constructs embedded in contending research traditions to build complex arguments that bear on substantive problems of interest to both scholars and practitioners.1\u0026rdquo;\n This conception - which strongly resonates with me - assumes a healthy division of labor between two social scientific camps (individual researchers can belong to both camps, even at the same time): first, there are the \u0026lsquo;normal scientists\u0026rsquo; that work in established research paradigms which define their questions and push them towards ever more elaborated and nuanced theories and empirical results; second, there are the analytical eclecticists which, as it were, parasitically utilize the conceptual and empirical knowledge accumulated in the paradigmatic sciences to answer questions that are defined less by a research tradition than by practical concerns.\nIn other words, normal scientists ask questions that mainly make sense in light of certain theoretical paradigms. In doing so, they accumulate ever more detailed knowledge about how the social world works. Analytic eclecticists ask questions that immediately make sense for practitioners or lay people as well, and they provide answers by synthetically combining concepts, causal mechanisms, or even methods from competing theoretical paradigms.2\nNested Analysis Evan Lieberman has proposed nested analysis as a mixed-method strategy for comparative and historical analyses as a way to\n \u0026ldquo;assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies.34\u0026rdquo;\n This way of thinking about mixed method research remains highly relevant and serves as an encouragement to provide the best evidence available in order to answer a given question (which, alas, is often discouraged by the fast-moving realities of academic publishing). The methodological suggestions laid out in Lieberman\u0026rsquo;s articles provide a lodestar for the papers I would like to write but am not always able to.\n  Sil, R. and Katzenstein, P.J.

A while ago, I wrote a (somewhat turgid) chapter about my thinking on this topic, which hasn\u0026rsquo;t changed much since. Unfortunately (and naturally), however, it is in German, so here is a quick summary of my thoughts.\nIn a nutshell, I find myself unconvinced by attempts to justify non-reductive forms of individualism.1 What do I mean by that? The central premise of non-reductive individualists is the emergentist claim that while social phenomena must always be realized in individuals (much like thoughts must always be somehow realized in brain activity), they are nonetheless irreducible to these underlying individual (or ultimately physical) processes in that they exert independent causal influences on them.\nWithout going into too much detail here, it strikes me as implausible that things that are always realized on a lower level can also be somehow independent of these lower levels (this is the same criticism that Jaegwon Kim2 has levelled against analogous arguments in the philosophy of mind). If everything always also has to happen on the lower level, there is simply nothing left to do for top-down causality. Either things happen on a higher level that don\u0026rsquo;t happen on a lower level, or there is no causal work left to do for higher-level processes.\nWithout going further down this rabbit hole, we find ourselves at an impasse. What seems obvious, namely that psychology or biology, not to speak of physics, don\u0026rsquo;t even come close to offering a reasonable explanation for the intricacies and eccentricities of social and political life, also seems philosophically questionable.\nThe problem is of course resolved if we acknowledge that the language game social scientists play offers incredibly useful shortcuts for describing processes that would be devilishly difficult to describe otherwise (it is, after all, also much easier to say \u0026ldquo;I am hungry\u0026rdquo; than to give an detailed account of the complex physiological processes that underlie both the feeling of hunger and its representation in the mind).\nBut if that is the case, why even bother with psychological or biological explanations? Why not just keep playing the social scientific language game if that gets us where we want to be? Well, it is not that easy either. That is because if we acknowledge that all social life is realized in individuals - that causality flows only between individuals and not from society \u0026ldquo;down\u0026rdquo; to individuals - we also need to acknowledge that our theories of social life should not contradict the best theories we have about individuals.\nBut fear not, fellow social scientists. In the pragmatist understanding I offer, the social sciences are not reduced to a biologistic or psychologistic science of the individual, but need only be compatible with their findings. This is not to say, of course, that social scientists cannot challenge these findings, but they should seriously engage with those that are well replicated and adjust their theories accordingly (for an excellent example, see Stephen Vaisey\u0026rsquo;s work on sociological theories of motivation and justification3).\nIt is in this spirit that I made the case for a more serious and sustained engagement between \u0026ldquo;human scientists\u0026rdquo; from different backgrounds. It heartening to see that multiple lines of research converge on similar conclusions, from the work on the social-evolutionary origins of human thinking and human morality4, to the work at the intersection of sociology and genetics5, to the \u0026ldquo;social turn\u0026rdquo; in many life sciences6, to the \u0026ldquo;psychological turn\u0026rdquo; in many subfields of political science.7\nI have no current projects in this area, but I am convinced that a full account of social life needs to take recourse to not only structural, institutional, and ideational explanations, but also to psychological (or biological) ones - sometimes this simply mean to make sure that our theories do not outrightly contradict \u0026ldquo;lower-level\u0026rdquo; theories, sometimes it means to actively incorporate (and advance) them.\n  Greve, J.

But they also produced a rich body of work at the intersection of social philosophy and empirical social science that I continue to feel drawn to.\nThe social philosophers of the Frankfurt School were among the first to insist on the connection between normative theorizing and empirical work. In looking at modern societies from this meta-theoretical vantage point, some of its members came to express an intuition that has always rung true to me: that despite its flaws, modernity (as an empirical phenomenon) is something (normatively) worth saving. Foremost among these thinkers is Jürgen Habermas. Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory of communicative action is an attempt to conceive of modernization as a deeply ambivalent process - a process that has released the search for truth, justice, and beauty from their traditional shackles while also untethering the capitalist from its societal bounds.1\nFor Habermas, the critic is called upon when the logic of systemic imperatives - the ruthless search for profit or the unjustified exercise of administrative power - distorts and subjugates the communicative logic of the lifeworld. It would mean doing injustice to the considerable sociological complexity of Habermas\u0026rsquo; theory to accuse him of empirical naivety. Habermas did of course not think that the lifeworld was free of power relations, even in the absence of encroaching systemic imperatives. But I always thought the major flaw in his theory was that it lacks a concept of \u0026lsquo;symbolic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;noumenal power\u0026rsquo;2 - of a power that affects the communicative taking and making of arguments itself, i.e., what people accept as \u0026lsquo;good reasons\u0026rsquo;.\nFoucault and the apotheosis of subversion This is problem is in a way the starting point for a second strand of social criticism. From Friedrich Nietzsche to Michel Foucault, these genealogical critics have attempt to drill holes in the solid concrete of the everyday lifeworld by asking its inhabitants to look in the mirror of their own, often dark and always contingent collective histories.3 The point of these genealogical critics, as Foucault readily acknowledges, is no longer to put criticism on normative foundation, but to elicit a \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;changes us, that prevents us from always being the same, or from having the same kind of relationship with things and others that we had before.\u0026quot;4 But this creates a problem: what is the point of eliciting such limit-experiences if there is no normative foundation from which to judge the relative quality of a given norm, practice, or social order? With no place left to stand on, the critic can only resort to celebrating the notion of subversion itself. Foucault says he does what he does so that those implicated in relations of power\n \u0026ldquo;might escape them through their actions of resistance and rebellion, might transform them in order not to be subjugated any longer. And if I don\u0026rsquo;t ever say what must be done, it isn\u0026rsquo;t because I believe that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to be done; on the contrary, it is because I think that there are a thousand things to do, to invent, to forge, on the part of those who, recognizing the relations of power in which they\u0026rsquo;re implicated, have decided to resist or escape them. From this point of view all of my investigations rest on a postulate of absolute optimism. I do not conduct my analyses in order to say: this is how things are, look how trapped you are. I say certain things only to the extent to which I see them as capable of permitting the transformation of reality.\u0026quot;3\n But why subversion - and the \u0026ldquo;limit-experience\u0026rdquo; it elicits - is better than compliance is not - and cannot be - answered. If everything solid melts into air, we can only hope to land softly.\nBourdieu and the freedom in determinism A third strand of social criticism, most eloquently developed by Pierre Bourdieu, has maneuvered itself into a similar cul-de-sac. For Bourdieu, social criticism is deeply entangled with questions of social determinism. In his sociological work, he had demonstrated the structuring effects of social fields and social power. For Bourdieu, communicative action was always distorted by the pernicious logic of symbolic power - the power that makes the dominated accept and internalize the reasons for their domination.\nBut for Bourdieu there was a way out, at least sort of. For Bourdieu, and here he agreed with Foucault, there was no going back behind the knowledge and acknowledgment of our own historicity - the fact that who we are and what we believe, as individuals and societies, is profoundly shaped by social and historical forces. But this, Bourdieu insisted, does not mean abandoning the possibility of criticism but rather radicalizing it by asking about the social conditions of its possibility.\n \u0026ldquo;In short, it is only through recognizing one\u0026rsquo;s historicity that it becomes possible for Reason to extricate itself from it\u0026rdquo;5\n What Bourdieu means here is that we can only think of escaping our historicity - the ways in which history and society shape us - if we understand and acknowledge it, much like we could only build airplanes after we understood and acknowledged the laws of gravity. Freedom, then, does not disappear in the face of determinism but requires us to recognize it. But, Bourdieu realizes, our ability to uncover the laws that govern social life is itself a product of history.\n \u0026ldquo;I tend to pose the question regarding reason, or norms in a radically historical way. My initial question would be: in whose interest is universalism? or what are the social conditions in which certain actors come to be interested in it? (\u0026hellip;) This historicism has to be pushed to its limits through radical doubt in order to see what can still be saved 6\u0026rdquo;\n For Bourdieu, science itself is the product of contingent (and reversible) historical circumstances that have established a situation in which all actors have an interest in finding the truth - as opposed to politically convenient, economically lucrative, or morally comfortable lies. This is why science is so important; it carves out a socially constructed space for people to pursue the truth - and to get something out of it. Only under these conditions - however imperfect they may be - can we hope to understand and therefore at least somewhat escape - the iron laws of determinism.\nThe social critic as a gardener It is here that my thinking on social criticism has arrived - at least for the moment. We, as (social) scientists are the privileged children of modernity which has put us in a position to be able to play a game in which we can win by pursuing the truth, at least in principle. And in doing so, we can provide individuals and societies with the knowledge to understand and accept their own complicity in historically grown and socially structured power relations. And it is this knowledge that they need to make - in acts of communicative interaction - decisions about their individual and collective fate that have at least the semblance of freedom. For me, then, the job of the social critic is much like the job of the gardener: to remove the weed of false freedom - freedom ignorant of its determination - in order to give the delicate flower of true freedom - freedom educated about its own determination - a chance to blossom.\n  Habermas, J.

And while I no longer actively pursue this question, some of the underlying concerns remain very close to my heart.\nState identities In particular, I remain fascinated by what constitutes and defines a state\u0026rsquo;s identity. In my own work, I found surprisingly deep ideational and organizational continuities in German foreign policy – continuities that out-lived partisan changes. I also found that ideas - from a default ordoliberal view of the economy, to a vaguely felt obligation to the German national interest, to the widely shared believe that Germany is, by and large, a force for good in the world - to be important drivers of foreign policy decisions.\nIn more recent work, I take up this question of state identity in the context of economic and fiscal policymaking. How, for example, does the way states understand themselves and their role in the economy influence their spending decisions?1 How do their views on the virtues of debt shape their views of the relative merits of savings and investments?2\nThe geopolitics of political economy Another way in which my thinking on German foreign policy continues to inform my current work is by making me take the geopolitical dimension of politico-economic phenomena seriously. Especially in a world of \u0026lsquo;weaponized interdependence\u0026rsquo;3, geopolitics and the politics of economic and public policymaking are inextricably intertwined. Geopolitical concerns are crucial for innovation and innovation policy4; questions of internet governance are increasingly complicated by the geopolitical competition between different visions and versions of the internet; and, as I showed in my own work on Germany\u0026rsquo;s response to the euro crisis, seemingly economic decisions are in fact motivated by geopolitical ambitions as much as by economic interests.\n  Mazzucato, M.

The money that flows from it is the life blood that sustains an ecosystem of products and services that has become so natural to us that we often forget how contingent (and strange) it actually is. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying this as an external observer. In fact, I rely on this ecosystem as much as anyone. Just in the last few hours, I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at Google Maps to see how to best get to a friend\u0026rsquo;s place; I\u0026rsquo;ve used Facebook\u0026rsquo;s Messenger to coordinate an event; I\u0026rsquo;ve scrolled through Twitter; I\u0026rsquo;ve watched a Kurzgesagt video on Youtube about what happened if the Earth got kicked out of the solar system; and I\u0026rsquo;ve listened to the second of two recent Freakonomics episodes on whether (digital) advertising actually works. None of this cost me anything, thanks to the (dark) magic of advertising. I\u0026rsquo;d be surprised - no utterly flabbergasted - if anyone reading this had not, just in the last few hours, used at least one product or service funded by advertising.\nLike it or not, \u0026ldquo;in 2020, the business of the internet is, by and large, an advertising business\u0026rdquo; (p. 4). Digital advertising has made Google and Facebook into two of the 7 most valuable companies on the planet; it has given us incredibly useful free services such as Google Maps or Google Scholar, it has subsidized research on autonomous driving or A.I.-assisted cancer diagnosis, and, most importantly, it has profoundly shaped what we do on and how we think about the internet. The question that Tim Hwang raises in Subprime Attention Crisis is whether the impressive economic edifice of an ad-driven digital economy is built on speculative sand, and whether this sets the stage for a sudden and painful adjustment of inflated expectations and valuations to a more sober reality - much like what happened with subprime mortgages before the financial crisis (hence the title). The answer to these questions, Hwang argues, is largely yes - an argument that he drives home with the simple clarity and analytic authority of someone who knows how the digital sausage is made. There are two ways in particular in which Hwang adds to what the existing literatures on the attention economy and surveillance capitalism have already established. First, Hwang does not stop at the observation that advertising is a marketplace for attention but goes on to ask and explain \u0026ldquo;precisely what kind of marketplace online advertising is\u0026rdquo; (p. 12). So what kind of marketplace is it? It is a marketplace that bears a lot more resemblance to modern-day financial markets, where machines do most of the buying and selling, than to the \u0026ldquo;practice of selling billboards in the Mad Men era of the 1960s\u0026rdquo; (p. 13). Hwang goes on to show that this uncanny resemblance between financial markets and programmatic advertising - the leveraging of software to auction slices of attention millions of times per second - is \u0026ldquo;no accident\u0026rdquo; (p. 15). It is a choice that was both contingent in its origins and profound in its implications.\nHwang shows that the structural transformation of advertising markets into quasi-financial markets for human attention was not a foregone conclusion. Online advertising could have developed differently - and with it the entire digital economy. It is one of the great contributions of this book to describe - with less jargon, fewer words, and more clarity than anything I\u0026rsquo;ve read on this before - how the design of online advertising markets \u0026ldquo;has been inspired not by the culture of nerds in garages but instead by the more buttoned-up world of the capital markets\u0026rdquo; (p. 34). Technology here is only a necessary condition for such modern online advertising markets to work; but it is the performative models of how markets work - imported from financial markets and championed by specific individuals like the economist Hal Varian at Google - that made these markets into what they are today.\n \u0026ldquo;Technology enables the game to be played, but it does not dictate the rules of that game. The second, equally important development that gave birth to the programmatic advertising marketplace was ideological: the adoption of the mental frames of finance\u0026rdquo; (p. 41).\n The result of this marriage between digital technology and a financial logic profoundly shaped the way we act and interact on the internet. It led to an extreme form of commodification of attention, in which attention is standardized and abstracted into discrete units (such as a \u0026ldquo;viewable impression\u0026rdquo;, in the industry’s jargon) which can then be sold \u0026ldquo;frictionlessly in a global marketplace\u0026rdquo; (p. 43). An example for how the imperatives of such a marketplace shape the architecture of the internet itself is the like button. Commodification, Hwang writes, requires attention to be \u0026ldquo;legible (\u0026hellip;) [advertising platforms] must structure \u0026lsquo;engagement\u0026rsquo; in a way that it is easy and accurate to measure\u0026rdquo; (p. 116). The like button is a way to do just that - it invites certain types of easily measurable \u0026ldquo;engagement\u0026rdquo; while discouraging others. It thus shapes what we do on the internet, while mainly serving the advertising business model. The like button has become so ingrained into our daily routines that we barely even notice it anymore, and have a hard time imagining different ways of liking content on the internet.\nThis brings us to the second big contribution of Subprime Attention Crisis: that online advertising markets not only structurally resemble financial markets, but that they also produce some of the same pathologies. Here, Hwang goes in a different direction than much of the existing literature. Instead of pointing to the invasive, individually and collectively harmful nature of business models that rely on the commodification of human attention (a genre which has culminated in Shoshana Zuboff\u0026rsquo;s massive The Age of Surveillance Capitalism), Hwang questions the economic foundations of these business models themselves. This is a welcome change. For one, it does not force the author to concede too much to the promises of the tech platforms. If one\u0026rsquo;s point does not depend on the ability of these companies to skillfully predict and manipulate human attention, then one is much freer to question this ability and throw some sand into the very hype machine that makes digital advertising so appealing.\nThis is where Hwang\u0026rsquo;s book is so valuable. It is basically an elaborated case for why the emperors of digital advertising wear in fact no (or very little) clothes - and why that is a problem not just for the emperors but for the economy at large (the irritation that Hwang\u0026rsquo;s book reportedly caused in Silicon Valley suggests that Hwang is everything but wrong). And in a way, and this makes the emperor-has-no-clothes-comparison so apt, we all knew this. I\u0026rsquo;m always amazed, for example, when people still don\u0026rsquo;t use ad blockers, and at how different the internet looks to them. I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed that I got pretty good at quickly detecting, ignoring, and skipping ads that I still encounter. In fact, if you look at the cover of Subprime Attention Crisis and are quickly able to identify both author and title of the book amidst all the \u0026lsquo;ads\u0026rsquo;, you should be able to do the same on the internet (I am indebted to Leon for this very perceptive observation).\nBut let us take one step back and see how Hwang goes beyond this intuition to make a much more comprehensive, theoretically sophisticated and empirically substantiated case against the online advertising economy. First, Hwang shows why the value of online advertising may be much lower than its price - and why this value has been decreasing over time. On the one hand, and this is what I have just pointed to, people increasingly ignore or actively resist online advertising. For example, banner-type ads are estimated to be a 100 times less effective than 25 years ago, and a recent experimental study on online advertising found that \u0026ldquo;brand keyword ads have no measurable short‐term benefits\u0026rdquo; while non‐brand keywords result \u0026ldquo;in average returns that are negative.\u0026rdquo; At the same time, ad blocking gets more and more popular around the world. Already in 2016, 615 million devices were actively blocking ads, and in 2019 around 30% of internet users use ad blockers. Digital ads, then, might be far less effective than their sellers try to make us believe - they might be \u0026ldquo;not so much a miracle cure as snake oil\u0026rdquo; (p. 141). On the other hand, the attention that ads still receive \u0026ldquo;is increasingly garbage - the product of a massive, fraudulent economy designed to extract money from advertisers\u0026rdquo; (p. 77). For example, in 2017 the Financial Times noticed that fraudsters were selling fake Financial Times ad inventory on many different ad exchanges, making around $1.3 Million per month.\nSecond, Hwang shows how the opacity of online advertising markets makes it very difficult to assess the actual value of advertising, creating conditions ripe for market failure. Worse yet, neither buyers nor sellers are likely to put an end to the divergence between the value and the price of advertising, which effectively inflates a bubble. On the demand side, \u0026ldquo;advertising budgets are pouring into this market bubble because they have nowhere else to go\u0026rdquo; (p. 94). Hwang draws an analogy with the savings glut hypothesis which argues that large flows of money in search for profitable investments can create bubbles, simply because the money has to go somewhere. Here, Hwang\u0026rsquo;s argument would have benefitted from a closer analysis of the organizational and ideational reasons why companies don\u0026rsquo;t cut back on advertising (perhaps because advertisers have a large say in these decisions) or why they thought that digital advertising is the best or safest bet for existing budgets (perhaps because digital platforms have successfully branded digital advertising as the future of advertising). On the supply side, Hwang argues that a \u0026ldquo;potent brew of greed and insulation from consequences can encourage players to stoke the market and overvalue what is being traded\u0026rdquo; (p. 101-102). Again, much like in financial markets, there are actors like marketing/rating agencies or the operators of programmatic advertising/creators or mortgage-backed securities that have an incentive to inflate the value of ads/mortgage-backed securities.\nIn a way, an ad itself is like a financial derivative in that its price derives from an underlying product - in that case not mortgages but the attention that they promise to capture. If that attention is subprime, there is a dangerous disconnect between price and value of the derivates - a disconnect that the history of financial crisis teaches us can only temporarily be covered up by opacity and perverse incentives. But eventually, actors will realize that a commodity is overpriced, prices will \u0026lsquo;snap\u0026rsquo; closer to their real value, and an ensuing panic or crisis of confidence can severely cripple a sector (or even an entire economy) for years to come.\nThis brings us to the last point of the book: what is to be done about the brewing subprime attention crisis? Here, Hwang argues for a \u0026ldquo;controlled demolition\u0026rdquo; (p. 114). There are three reasons why this demolition should be controlled, i.e., why we should not just let things runs their course and wait for the bubble to implode. First, bubbles grow larger over time, and the larger they are the more damage they do. Second, a controlled demolition makes it easier to distribute the social costs of the crisis equitably. Third, \u0026ldquo;an uncontrolled popping of the bubble is less likely to lead to permanent change\u0026rdquo; (p. 121). These points are well worth considering, and they point to some of the larger of the way the digital economy is currently organized. After all, it is a problem that so much of our digital infrastructure depends on advertising, and it is not easy to see how these things can be funded differently and equitably. There are of course subscription-based models, the shift to which is perhaps the most important development in the digital economy today. But not only do such shifts take time, which is why we need to make sure that alternative ecosystems have the time establish themselves before the advertising ecosystem comes crashing down. It is also unclear if a subscription-based model is really such a good deal for many people. Sure, it takes the edge off the polarizing and privacy-violating practices of today\u0026rsquo;s attention merchants. But advertising also finances a whole host of free services that are both valuable and would be impossible to afford for some if subscription-based:\n \u0026ldquo;Imagine waking up to the announcement that searching the web would now require a monthly subscription fee, or that your favorite social network would have limited features until you added a credit card to sign up for a premium version. Imagine being charged on a per-trip basis for navigating with Google Maps. Think of WhatsApp—which was acquired by Facebook in 2014 but has not made significant money for the platform10—being shut down in order to preserve Facebook’s bottom line. How much would you be willing to pay for these services? What would you shell out for, and what would you leave behind?\u0026rdquo; (p. 26-27).\n Hwang does provide concrete suggestions for how to deflate the online advertising bubble. For example, he proposes the establishment of a National Bureau of Advertising Research (NBAR) modeled after the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) which could systematically scrutinize the \u0026ldquo;two pillars of faith\u0026rdquo; of programmatic advertising: measurability and effectiveness. He also proposes the introduction of transparency regulations modeled after mandatory disclosure legislation in financial markets (a reasonable but surprisingly tame suggestion). He does not, however, have a detailed proposal as to how the positive effects of advertising (e.g., free services or the funding of independent media) can be put on an alternative financial footing. To be clear, Hwang leaves no doubt that the end of online advertising as we know it “could deny vulnerable segments of the population access to the critical services that they have come to rely on. Failing to address these issues in advance would be a cruel kind of irresponsibility\u0026rdquo; (p. 121). But what does that mean in practice: should there be a bail-out package if hundreds of thousands of YouTubers, Tiktokers, and Instagrammers are suddenly (or even slowly) cut off from advertising money? Should there be a publicly guaranteed access to services like Google Maps? And if so, should these be public (and potentially subpar) services or will there be a voucher system where individuals can decide whether they want to spend their digital allowance on Google Maps or a newspaper subscription (an arguably less appealing but, given the move of digital platforms into the provision of public goods, increasingly likely scenario)?\nHaving said this, Hwang\u0026rsquo;s book is clearly on of the most important books written on tech in recent years. Not only does it masterfully dissect modern attention economies and carve out the myriad connections between financial and digital capitalism. It also a timely warning cry for an overhyped digital economy that has benefitted for too long from the strange fact that both its supporters and its critics had reason to hype the abilities of digital attention merchants. This is not to say that their promises are entirely void, nor that the entire digital economy relies on advertising (Amazon, Apple, Netflix or Microsoft are just a few obvious counterexamples). But it is to say that there is very good reason to believe that many digital business models are built on foundations that are shakier than many people believe, and that we better demolish this glittery edifice in a controlled manner and replace it with something better, rather than letting it collapse uncontrollably.\nTo conclude on an ornithological metaphor, Hwang is doing the job of three birds. Like a reverse Owl of Minerva, which in Hegel\u0026rsquo;s famous description \u0026lsquo;spreads its wings only with the falling of the dusk\u0026rsquo;, he makes sense of a historical condition not as it has almost ended but as it is doing better than ever. Taking his flight already with the dawning of day, Hwang provides a powerful anticipatory autopsy of an existing and growing bubble at the heart of the digital economy. Like a canary in the digital coal mine, he warns the rest of us of its potentially detrimental consequences just before it is too late (one could have also used the metaphor of the Capitoline geese here). And drawing inspiration from the Phoenix, Hwang makes sure to let us know that something better can arise from the ashes of the digital advertising economy. In an almost Hölderlinian spirit of \u0026lsquo;where there is danger, also grows the saving power\u0026rsquo;, Hwang stresses that the imminent crisis could be a chance for renewing and redesigning the digital economy itself. \u0026ldquo;The collapse of the global advertising market would produce a great opportunity for alternative business models to take shape, and a chance for the internet to take a different shape as well\u0026rdquo; (p. 119). Given that it seems almost easier to imagine a world without the internet than to imagine an internet without advertising, it is naturally hard to sketch exactly how that would look like. But it is certainly worth thinking about it now, and to be prepared when people will inevitably look for new ideas in the interregnum between what is now and what is to come.\n","date":1607385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607385600,"objectID":"1830ba577b1b97762bf60ce9395f791d","permalink":"/blog/2020/12/the-shaky-foundations-of-the-digital-economy/","publishdate":"2020-12-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2020/12/the-shaky-foundations-of-the-digital-economy/","section":"post","summary":"Advertising, Tim Hwang writes in his brilliant anatomy of the attention economy, is \u0026ldquo;the dark beating heart of the internet\u0026rdquo; (p. 3).

Conceptual historians were particularly concerned with how fundamental concepts such as constitution, democracy, interest, opposition, or progress changed their meaning during the transition to modernity and therefore how people thought about and acted upon them.\nA central tenet of Begriffsgeschichte is that words need to be seperated from concepts, and that the same words can come to mean very different things - just as the same concepts can be expressed with different words - as they make their way through history. Looked at that way, What Tech calls Thinking can be read as a series of conceptual histories of pet phrases that occupy places of honor in Silicon Valley\u0026rsquo;s crooked philosophical edifice: dropping out, content, genius, communication, desire, disruption, and failure. Each of them has a longer history that tech elites woe- or willfully ignore, distort, or missapproiate; they \u0026ldquo;pretend to be novel but are actually old motifs playing dress-up in a hoodie\u0026rdquo; (p. 6-7). And each of them is used \u0026ldquo;by the rich and powerful to make distinctions without difference, and elide differences that are politically important to recognize\u0026rdquo; (p. 7). They are smokescreens that distract from the harmful side-effects of digital business models, and building blocks for Potemkin villages that portray a fake reality that is far removed from what is actually going on.\nTake the concept of disruption, which made its first appearance in the Communist Manifesto when its authors recognized the \u0026ldquo;constant revolutionising of production” and “uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions\u0026rdquo; as central features of life under capitalism. Around a century later, Jospeh Schumpeter takes up this observation when arguing that creative destruction - the incessant revolution of the economy from within - is in fact what keeps the capitalist engine going. Both Marx and Schumpeter, while very differnt in political leaning, thought that this dynamic, never-ending instability would lead to political instability and eventually to capitalism\u0026rsquo;s downfall. Disruption contains the seed of capitalism\u0026rsquo;s destruction. The modern, valley-washed version of disruption, however, is utterly devoid either of an optimistic (Marx) or a pessimistic (Schumpeter) outlook. Disruption today no longer suggests\n \u0026ldquo;that the ever-intensifying rapids of creative destruction will eventually lead to the placid waters of a new stability, that hypercapitalism almost inevitably pushes us toward something beyond capitalism. Instead, disruption seems to suggest that the rapids are all there is and can be—we might as well strap in for the ride. Often enough, talk of disruption is a theodicy of hypercapitalism. Disruption is newness for people who are scared of genuine newness. Revolution for people who don’t stand to gain anything from revolution\u0026rdquo; (p. 124).\n Disruption, then, has taken on a strangely uncritical, conservative slate that, not coincidentally, bends it towards the interests of tech companies. On the one hand, disruption itself is being tamed, and in the process stripped of any radicalism. Disruption \u0026ldquo;acts as though it thoroughly disrespects whatever existed previously, but in truth it often seeks to simply rearrange whatever exists. It is possessed of a deep fealty to whatever is already given. It seeks to make it more efficient, more exciting, more something, but it never wants to dispense altogether with what’s out there\u0026rdquo; (p. 105). Anand Giridharadas has recently documented how elites have co-opted and thereby transformed the notion of social change, channeling it into philanthropic avenues that all but preserve the status quo and obsurce their role in causing the problems they later seek to solve. In much the same way, digital capitalists have co-opted the notion of economic disruption, creating a narrative in which they can act like Goliaths and talk like Davids.\nOn the other hand, tech companies endorse a shallow metaphysics of inefficiency. The world is full of bugs and therefore every disruption is an upgrade. If the status quo is fundamentally flawed, the disruptor becomes something of an anti-establishment hero, even if he (it is usually a he) leads a 100-billion dollar company putting a newspaper with a few dozens employees out of business. The disruptor, in other words, \u0026ldquo;portrays even the most staid cottage industry as a Death Star against which its plucky rebels have to do battle\u0026rdquo; (p. 128). Here, we encounter a central argument of Daub\u0026rsquo;s book, namely that concepts used by tech companies can be powerful tools in shaping how we think about them, and therefore powerful weapons in the regulatory battles that decide over their profit margins or even their existence.\nAn example for how the \u0026ldquo;limits of our thinking very quickly become the limits of our politics\u0026rdquo; (p. 5-6) is another concept that could well be included in the pantheon of fraught tech terms: the platform. The notion of a platform, as Tarleton Gillespie has pointed out long ago, suggests an egalitarian arrangment that supports those who stand on it, obscuring the control regime and dependency relationship that is at the heart of most platforms. As Maha Atal has recently argued, the notion of being a platform has allowed tech companies “to straddle the very categories that we use to organize our understanding of the political and economic world, [which places them] in the institutional cracks of the regulatory system [which they] consciously exploit (…) to thwart challenges to their power.” This matters a great deal since tech companies are not only economic but also regulatory entrepreneurs whose business models is based on ignoring, bending, or changing the product and labor market regulations they and their competitors face. As I show in this paper, companies like Uber are very aware of this and actively (and succesfully) use empowering narratives and clever framing to manage their \u0026lsquo;non-market environment\u0026rsquo;, that is, how policymakers and the public perceive them.\nWhat Tech calls Thinking is a powerful conceptual history of some of the most prominent ideas that tech elites use in these discursive battles. But are these concepts mere tools that tech elites use to, in Franklin Foer\u0026rsquo;s phrase, reconfigure our ideals in order to justify their business models (p. 1-2)? Or is there more to them? Daub\u0026rsquo;s hints at as much when he argues that these concepts may also help \u0026ldquo;avoid cognitive dissonance\u0026rdquo; when tech elites need to square their rebellious, do-gooder self-image with the power they have and the problems they cause - the drop-out narrative, the genuis aesthetic and the celebration of failure certainly help in this regard. What I missed in Daub\u0026rsquo;s account is a more systematic discussion of the role that these ideas play for the course and character of digital capitalism ifself. Do these ideas only justify capitalism externally, vis a vis the public and policymakers, or also internally, vis a vis employees? How does that work? And do they merely sooth the torn conscience of tech elites or also shape their decisions in ways that are not straightforwardly instrumental? Are these ideas just bullshit, or are tech elites also bullshitting, in Harry Frankfurt\u0026rsquo;s sense of being entirely insincere about them? (Oliver Nachtwey and I think about these questions more deeply in our paper on \u0026lsquo;The Solutionist Ethic and the Spirit of Digital Capitalism\u0026rsquo;.)\nThe book is a short one, and there would have certainly been space for a synoptic conclusion that reflects more on this question. One could have also wished for a more far-ranging discussion of some of the concepts themselves. For example, while Daub brilliantly reconstructs the twisted history and hypocrtical nature of the Valley\u0026rsquo;s discourse on failure, he remains silent about how our forgetfulness of the ubiqutious failures of technology protect the standing and dynamism of the tech sector - and argument recently explored in Arjun Appadurai and Neta Alexander\u0026rsquo;s Failure, which I reviewed here. But Daub more than makes up for this with his incredibly crisp and insightful short conceptual histories, which effortlessly walk us through the arguments of McLuhan, Girard, Ayn Rand, and many more, and weave them together with observations about the Damore memo, the movie Ratatouille, the Theranos scandal, and the culture of trolling. If this were not inevitably interpreted as a backhanded compliment, I would even say that, in this regard, Daub reminded me of Slavoj Žižek during his better days.\nThe flip side of Daub\u0026rsquo;s wit is a sometimes somewhat condescending tone, for example when he describes reading 25 books of the Western canon as \u0026ldquo;sort of respectable\u0026rdquo; (p. 27) or, with the learned and somewhat smug habitus of the Stanford professor of Comparative Literature, scorns those that only have a superficial grasp of the concepts they ventilate at TED talks. I understand that this is part of the point, and it is not that the victims of Daub\u0026rsquo;s academic sneers deserve our pity - but I, for one, was put off by it at times. This notwithstanding, What Tech calls Thinking is a great (and short) book that should be essential reading for everyone trying to understand the ideology of Silicon Valley and what makes its inhabitants tick. In addition, as others have already pointed out, is full of memorable aperçus, such as when Daub describes Elon Musk\u0026rsquo;s tunnel-boring projects as technological entrepreneurship approaching \u0026ldquo;performance art\u0026rdquo; (p. 70), and his bold plans to single-handely save a group of boys in a cave in Thailand as the \u0026ldquo;seemingly impossible trick of giving compassion a Randian hue\u0026rdquo; (p. 64). But the book is more than a collection of witty lines. There is this worn-out phrase that one often hears in and around tech, that the best way to predict the future is to build it. What Daub shows us it that to understand the future, we need to pay close attention to the history of the ideas that inform those that set out to build it.\n","date":1606262400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606262400,"objectID":"e567852cc54567dbab07c09e8ed5173c","permalink":"/blog/2020/11/thinking-shallow-but-powerful/","publishdate":"2020-11-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2020/11/thinking-shallow-but-powerful/","section":"post","summary":"When reading Adrian Daub\u0026rsquo;s masterful dissection of the ideas that inform what tech is - or calls - thinking, I was reminded of the idea and practice of conceptual history or Begriffsgeschichte.","tags":null,"title":"Thinking, Shallow but Powerful","type":"post"},{"authors":["Timo Seidl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"1426c637dde889517ec878e51df10a0b","permalink":"/publication/talkin-about-digitalization/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/talkin-about-digitalization/","section":"publication","summary":"Working Paper","tags":null,"title":"Talkin’ bout Digitalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moritz Laurer","Timo Seidl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588723200,"objectID":"58956f1a842bd000ad627036c214e459","permalink":"/publication/regulating-the-european-data-driven-economy/","publishdate":"2020-05-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/regulating-the-european-data-driven-economy/","section":"publication","summary":"Published in Policy \u0026 Internet","tags":null,"title":"Regulating the European Data-Driven Economy.
