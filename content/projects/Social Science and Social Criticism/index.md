It is perhaps the *Gretchenfrage* for every social scientist: "how do you feel about social criticism?" 

## Frankfurt School and the search for a yardstick

I have long been fascinated by attempts to develop something like a normative yardstick by which to judge whether a particular social practice or arrangment is good or bad, worthy of critic or deserving of praise. 

In a certain sense, these attempts to put social critcism on an 'objective' foundation were of course doomed to fail. But they also produced a rich body of work at the intersection of social philsophpy and empirical social science that I continue to feel drawn to, and that is, perhaps, the saving grace of the Frankfurt School, which has first developed but not always lived up to promise of this interdisciplinary approach.

In addition, many of the thinkers of the Frankfurt School, above all Jürgen Habermas, expressed an intution that has always rung true to me: that despite its flaws, modernity is something worth saving. Habermas own theory is an attempt to show how the process of moderization has released the rationality potential embedded in human language. This same process of modernization, however, now threatens to undermine the progress it has made possible as an unteethered capitalist system wreaks havoc on the very lifeworlds from where it once emerged.[^1]

## The French and the search for a way out

This approach to social criticism is of course not the only one possible. From Friedrich Nietzsche to Michel Foucault, there is a long history of genealogical critics, which attempt to drill holes in the solid concrete of taken-for-granted lifeworlds by forcing societies to look into the mirror of their own, often dark and always contingent histories.[^2] The point of these genealogical critics, as Foucault readily acknowledges, is no longer to put criticism on normative foundation, but to elicit a "limit-experience" that "changes us, that prevents us from always being the same, or from having the same kind of relationoship with things and others that we had before."[^3]

This, of course, leads to a point where everything solid melts into air, as Marx once put it, even the purpuose of the genealogical critcism itself. Foucault says he does what he does so that those implicated in relations of power

> "might escape them through their actions of resistance and rebellion, might transform them in order not to be subjugated any longer. And if I don't ever say what must be done, it isn't because I believe that there's nothing to be done; on the contrary, it is because I think that there are a thousand things to do, to invent, to forge, on the part of those who, recognizing the relations of power in which they're implicated, have decided to resist or escape them. From this point of view all of my investigations rest on a postulate of absolute optimism. I do not conduct my analyses in order to say: this is how things are, look how trapped you are. I say certain things only to the extent to which I see them as capable of permitting the transformation of reality."[^3]

Foucault, then, does not want to be the one who criticizes but hopes that his genealogical descriptions might elicit rebellion in the reader. Why rebellion is better than non-rebellion, why replacing one system of power with another, is a question that Foucault does not have an answer for.

I always found this position frustrating, thought that we could 'do better', not just by developing standards that are at least better justifiable.
