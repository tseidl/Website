More than a hundred years ago, Max Weber asked himself a question that still vexes the social sciences. How, he wondered, can ideas become "effective forces in history?"[^1] How can things like frames and narratives, worldviews and belief systems, visions of the futures and conjurations of the past change the ways in which people act and interact?

For a long time, many social scientists have had a somewhat standoffish relationship with ideational explanations. During the cold war, the study of ideas sounded an awful lot like the study of ideology - an anathema for a new generation of self-confident social scientists who wanted to stay clear of the muddy waters of intellectual politics.[^2] Many of them believed that ideas were not really explanatory variables in themselves but should be seen as “the product of circumstances and interests” or, at most, as “weapons framed for the furtherance of interests."[^3] 

Others thought that ideas may well matter, but that they were simply too hard to measure. Ideas, as Philip Converse famously quipped, are a "primary exhibits for the doctrine that what is important to study cannot be measured and that what can be measured is not important to study."[^4]

It is, of course, rather curious “that scholars, whose entire existence is centered on the production and understanding of ideas, should grant ideas so little significance for explaining political life.”[^5] But not only that. Why, one wonders, would businesses and politician waste billions on spin doctors and PR wizards if ideas did not actually matter? And why would ordinary people spend so much time and energy defending and attacking things that are in fact 'epiphenomenal'?

> “The tens of millions of dollars that are spent on think tanks to churn out ideas and public relations firms to market them would be largely wasted. The billions of dollars spent on market research and on advertising would be unnecessary. (…) In politics, people would vote exclusively out of material self-interest. There would no longer be anything the matter with Kansas, and limousine liberals in Cambridge and Berkeley would become antitax crusaders. Job seekers would not choose careers because of their meaning; college students would stop trying to find themselves. Terrorists would not blow up buildings out of visions of religious glory or ideological triumph. There would be no such thing as a thought leader or a visionary.”[^6]

Ideas, it should be clear, do matter, and it comes as no surprise that ideational explanations have experienced something of a comeback since the 1990s. In my own research I try to build on and advance the theoretical and empirical work done by the scholars that have ushered in this ideational renaissance. Thanks to them, we no longer have to defend the claim *that* ideas matter but can focus on the much more interesting questions of *how* and *when* they matter, and how they can be *measured*?

Both theoretically and empirically, ideational scholarship has come a long way. 

- First, we now have the conceptual tools to clearly distinguish between ideas of different levels of generality: from something as general as economic cultures[^7] to programmatic beliefs that translate between abstract *Weltanschauungen* and concrete policy positions[^8] to something as - literally - hands-on as the Lafer curved sketched on a napkin (depicted on the image above).[^9]

- Second, we also have a much better understanding of how different cogntive and normative ideas interact with human psychology, for example as frames[^10] or mental models.[^11] I have more to say about this [here]({{< ref "/projects/Emergence, Reductionism, Pragmatism/index.md" >}}).

- Third, we now a much richer set of both qualitative and quantitative tools to trace the effects of ideas[^12] or identify them in a variety of unsupervised and supervised ways (something that I have more to say about [here]({{< ref "/projects/Text as Data/index.md" >}}) and here [here]({{< ref "/projects/Mixing Methods, Nesting Analyses/index.md" >}})).

- Finally, we have a much better grasp of what ideas can do and what can be done with them. On the one hand, scholars have made great strides in thinking about the causal paths through which ideas become 'effective forces in history'. Uncertainty, in particular, has been identified as the crucial causal wedge that gives ideas an entry point into social life.[^13] On the other hand, much progress has been made in sketching out how the causal effects of ideas are conditioned by the material and institutional structures in which actors operate.

The figure below summarizes much of my current thinking on ideas and politics. The way I see it, a focus on ideas can both illuminate how actors perceive their own interests, and, conversly, how actors use ideas to advanced their interests by manipulating how others perceive theirs. However, ideas don't operate in a vacuum. Their viability and sucess depend on whether they find the support of powerful groups, whether they align with existing institutions, or whether they make sense in light of other, dominant ideas.

What is important here is that ideational explanations are not meant to replace structural or institutional ones; rather, they are meant to provide more rounded accounts of agency within structural and institutional settings.[^14] They are meant to show how actors perceptions of their own interests is not just shaped by their structural or institutional position, but also by the things they happen to believe in. Likewise, actors engage in ideational politics to change how other actors perceive the world around them ('worldview politics') as well as their role in it ('identity politics').[^15]

It is this mutual or, if you want, dialektical relationship that I try to investigate empirically. For example, in my paper on the regulation of Uber in New York, I use discourse network analysis to show how ideas can both serve as "coalition magnets" for building alliances of strange bedfellows, and as coalitional wedges that can drive natural allies apart. In other work, such as in my comparative paper on digitalization discourses, I focus more on the ways in which structural, institutional, and cultural contexts shape the ways in which digitalization is framed and fought over.

The point is not to prioritize one approach over another, but to use the toolbox of modern ideational analysis to make sense of a world in which ideas are not only as "important to study" as ever - but can in fact be studied in ways that are both rigorous and do justice to the richness of political life.
