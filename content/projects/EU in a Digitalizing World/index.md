In a rapidly digitalizing world, the EU is busy finding its place. While Europe is widely seen as a regulatory heavyweight, it is not (yet) a technological or economic one. On the one hand, the GDPR is considered the global gold standard of data protection, the Digital Services and Markets Acts sent shock waves through the tech industry, and the world looks at Europe when trying to regulate artificial intelligence and data flows. On the other hand, Europe lacks digital giants of its own, it's lagging behind the US and China with regard to key technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and its plan, first articulated in the Lisbon Strategy, to make Europe 'the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world' has not come to fruition.


Thus, while Europe holds the promise to offer a third model of digitalization - one that differs from both the state-centered model of China and the market-based US model - it has only made partially good on this promise. This ambivalence forms the background of my research interest in the EU's ambition for and role in the digital age. The EU's ambition is about protecting 'the European way of life' as well as promoting European solutions abroad. But can the EU's role match this ambition? Is it enough to sustain a digital ['Brussel's effect'](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-brussels-effect-9780190088583?cc=at&lang=en&) whereby the EU's digital policies become the *de facto* or *de jure* standard in other jurisdictions? Or is it necessary for Europe to build digital capacities of its own? Moreover, is the EU even able to enforce its digital policies at home, given the [implementation problems](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/27/europe-gdpr-technology-regulation-089605) that have bedeviled the GDPR? And who is it actually that decides over the content of the EU's digital policies?

This yields three interrelated research questions.



The discursive center of gravity of Europe's discourse on digitalization is the notion of digital sovereignty. On the one hand, digital sovereignty refers to the ability to shape one's own digital destiny. As commission president [Ursula von der Leyen](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_20_1655) herself put it, in a digital world, "Europe must have [the capability] to make its own choices, based on its own values, respecting its own rules.”
At a second glance, however, being digitally sovereign is also seen as a prerequisite for being influential in an increasingly digitalized world. As the Commission put it in a recent communication: “For Europe to truly influence the way in which digital solutions are developed and used on a global scale, it needs to be a strong, independent and purposeful digital player in its own right” [@EuropeanCommission.2020]. In much the same vein, the Commission’s European Political Strategy Centre argued that the “EU’s ability to defend and promote its interests, as well as its credibility as a strong foreign policy actor, will largely be a function of its cyber resilience and technological command” [@EuropeanPoliticalStrategyCentre.2019].
