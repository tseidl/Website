abstract: In recent years, platform companies like Uber have caused much controversy. By disrupting markets and contesting regulatory regimes, they have come to epitomize both the promises and perils of platform capitalism. However, little attention has been paid to the politics of platform capitalism itself, that is, to the political processes in which platform are - or aren't - regulated. This paper starts filling this gap by developing, testing, and defending a framework based on three conceptual pillars&#58; coalitions, narratives and platform power. Using discourse network analysis and a case study on the regulation of Uber in New York, it shows that the success or failure of regulations depends on the ability of actors to mobilize broad coalition; that narratives affect the composition of these coalitions; and that platform companies have both unique political strengths and vulnerabilities. The paper contributes to the literatures on coalitional politics, ideational institutionalism, business power, and the politics of digital capitalism.
