&rArr; Digitalization has a disruptive and a **commodifying** thrust


<br>
<br>
<br>



&rArr; Digitalization is a politically contested and politically shaped process


]


???

- Direction to technological change

- Commodification:
  - new areas of social life are opened for commercial exploitation
  - existing de-commodifying institutions are put under pressure

- Disruption: skills become obsolete, business models become nonviable, competitive advantages disappear

- Digitalization as politically contested

-> Technological Change not just a technological phenomenon, shaped by political decisions

-> How can we understand these political decisions?

Data as a valuable asset: training data, advertising, product experience, but also behavioral manipulation. 

Deal at the heart of the internet: data in exchange for free stuff. Problem: data hunger lets companies colonize ever more areas of our lives, collecting data which can then be commercialized about all kinds of things (e.g. smart hairbrushes).

This in turn leads to follow-up problems: privacy comes at a price; there is a large information asymmetry; data can be used for manipulative purposes.

**But: ** Also a counter-movement against this commodification: political movements and powerful actors have pushed for greater data protection, trying to rebalance the tradeoffs between the fundamental right to data protection and commercial motives.

But when and how are such regulations adopted, and which explains the shape they take?

##Discussion questions 

###In general 
What questions came up when reading the articles / hearing the presentations? 
What would you suggest as main take away points? Did you miss some in the presentations?


Morozov: What would have been the Copernican revolution in Zuboff’s thought? Why has it, however, failed? 

###For further discussion
When thinking about the seminar title: how can we properly describe digital capitalism (considering both Zuboff’s surveillance-capitalism-theory and Morozov’s critique)?

## Colonization of the Lifeworld <br> by Digital Imperatives




.pull-left[


<font size="4.2"> 

>"In place of "false consciousness" we today have a "fragmented consciousness" that blocks enlightenment by the mechanism of reification. It is only with this that the conditions for a colonization of the lifeworld are met. **When stripped of their ideological veils, the imperatives of autonomous subsystems make their way into the lifeworld from the outside—like colonial masters coming into a tribal society—and force a process of assimilation upon it. The diffused perspectives of the local culture cannot be sufficiently coordinated to permit the play of the metropolis and the world market to be grasped from the periphery**." <br> 	&mdash; Jürgen Habermas, Theory of Communicative Action - Volume 2

### What, do you think, have tech companies such easy time collecting data from and about us?

Regardless of how literal we take the diagnosis of a colonization of our lives by tech companies, it seems that they do indeed have a rather easy time collecting data about us.

???
Just as the other forms of capital discussed by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, namely, economic capital, social capital (i.e. good connections) and cultural capital (e.g. good manners, education, etc.), übercapital has an input and an output dimension. On the one hand, it is accumulated over an individual´s biography, built up from the countless digital traces left behind on social media and shopping websites, fidelity and fitness programs. On the other hand, übercapital conveys advantages such as better credit ratings or reputational gains that can themselves be reconverted into other forms of capital.
