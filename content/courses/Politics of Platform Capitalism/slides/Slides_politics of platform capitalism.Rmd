&rArr; Digitalization has a disruptive and a **commodifying** thrust


<br>
<br>
<br>



&rArr; Digitalization is a politically contested and politically shaped process


]


???

- Direction to technological change

- Commodification:
  - new areas of social life are opened for commercial exploitation
  - existing de-commodifying institutions are put under pressure

- Disruption: skills become obsolete, business models become nonviable, competitive advantages disappear

- Digitalization as politically contested

-> Technological Change not just a technological phenomenon, shaped by political decisions

-> How can we understand these political decisions?

???

Data as a valuable asset: training data, advertising, product experience, but also behavioral manipulation. 

Deal at the heart of the internet: data in exchange for free stuff. Problem: data hunger lets companies colonize ever more areas of our lives, collecting data which can then be commercialized about all kinds of things (e.g. smart hairbrushes).

This in turn leads to follow-up problems: privacy comes at a price; there is a large information asymmetry; data can be used for manipulative purposes.

**But: ** Also a counter-movement against this commodification: political movements and powerful actors have pushed for greater data protection, trying to rebalance the tradeoffs between the fundamental right to data protection and commercial motives.

But when and how are such regulations adopted, and which explains the shape they take?

##Discussion questions 

###In general 
What questions came up when reading the articles / hearing the presentations? 
What would you suggest as main take away points? Did you miss some in the presentations?


Morozov: What would have been the Copernican revolution in Zuboff’s thought? Why has it, however, failed? 

###For further discussion
When thinking about the seminar title: how can we properly describe digital capitalism (considering both Zuboff’s surveillance-capitalism-theory and Morozov’s critique)?

>"In place of "false consciousness" we today have a "fragmented consciousness" that blocks enlightenment by the mechanism of reification. It is only with this that the conditions for a colonization of the lifeworld are met. **When stripped of their ideological veils, the imperatives of autonomous subsystems make their way into the lifeworld from the outside—like colonial masters coming into a tribal society—and force a process of assimilation upon it.

???
Just as the other forms of capital discussed by the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, namely, economic capital, social capital (i.e. good connections) and cultural capital (e.g. good manners, education, etc.), übercapital has an input and an output dimension. On the one hand, it is accumulated over an individual´s biography, built up from the countless digital traces left behind on social media and shopping websites, fidelity and fitness programs. On the other hand, übercapital conveys advantages such as better credit ratings or reputational gains that can themselves be reconverted into other forms of capital.

## Why Care about the Law?

.pull-left[

- Because we cannot talk about the economy without talking about "the (mostly legal) rules of the game where business is conducted" (Pistor 2019, 7).



- Because law is "the very cloth from which capital is cut" (Pistor 2019, 4) and capitalism is a "market economy in which some assets are placed on legal steroids" (Pistor 2019, 11).


- Because questions of economic inequality are unseparable from the power *of* the law and the power *over* the law, and therefore require a detailed understanding of the inner workings of the law.

<br>

- For there to be a market in genetic testing, property rights in genetic sequences need to be recognized and enforced by the state.

<br>

- Markets do not simply exist or emerge from the interplay of self-interested actors but are created legally, which often implies a legal enclose of the commons.

## Legal *Constructions* 




**Law is not only reactive, it can also be constructive:**
  
- Existing digital markets strongly rely on
  - the legality of access-for-data-arrangements
  - wide legal understandings of proprietary information (Intellectual property, trade secrecy)
  
- Platform companies rely on 
  - broad exemptions from accountability (Section 230)
  - legal doctrines of productive appropriation (from patent law)
  
  
**Legal Entrepreneurship is not only about changing the law, but also changing legal ideas:**

- Conceptions of data as out there, available for the taking

- the legitimacy of legal privilege and extreme power and information asymmetries

class: inverse, center, middle

What can we learn from Culpepper and Thelen's idea of platform power 
concerning the Facebook Oversight Board?

### UK Online Harms White Paper 2019
16. The government will establish a new *statutory duty of care* to make companies take more responsibility for the safety of their users and tackle harm caused by content or activity on their services.

17. Compliance with this duty of care will be overseen and *enforced by an independent regulator*.

18. All companies in scope of the regulatory framework will need to be able to show that they are fulfilling their duty of care. Relevant terms and conditions will be required to be sufficiently clear and accessible, including to children and other vulnerable users. The regulator will assess how effectively these terms are enforced as part of any regulatory action.

19. The *regulator will have a suite of powers to take effective enforcement* action against companies that have breached their statutory duty of care. This may include the powers to issue substantial fines and to *impose liability on individual members* of senior management.

20. Companies must fulfil the new legal duty. The regulator will set out how to do this in codes of practice. If companies want to fulfil this duty in a manner not set out in the codes, they will have to explain and justify to the regulator how their alternative approach will effectively deliver the same or greater level of impact.

> “Before the Internet, it would be really difficult to find someone, sit them down for ten minutes and get them to work for you, and then fire them after those ten minutes. But with technology, you can actually find them, pay them the tiny amount of money, and then get rid of them when you don’t need them anymore.” <br>	&mdash; Lukas Biewald, CEO CrowdFlower

# Seeing and not Seeing II

>"Well, you know, I think the non-intuitive thing about our business is that the cheaper the service gets, the more luxurious it gets. Let me explain. (...) Well, when the price goes down, you have more riders because more riders can afford it. But if you have more riders that means you have more drivers, and if you have more drivers that means that your pick up times are shorter. It also means that wherever you go in a city, you're more likely to get a ride back. And so it just so happens in our business non-intuitively, when the price goes down, the system or the product or the service becomes more luxurious. And so this isn't a race to the bottom in sort of the traditional sense, it's that the lower we go, the better the service gets. And that's why we do what we do." <br>	&mdash; Travis Kalanick, CEO Uber

### Views, Narratives, Images of platforms are powerful tools in the poltics of platform capitalism. Your task is to develop a view of your own, centered around a key metaphor. Focus here on social media platforms. 

#### Either come up with a metaphor of your own and develop it

#### Or use the metaphor of social media platforms as public parks and see how far you get
