<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>Digital technologies are rapidly transforming the way we live our lives and organize our societies and economies. This process of digitalization, whereby more and more of what we think, say, and do becomes mediated by digital technologies, confronts societies with a number of challenges ranging from questions of competition policy to content moderation to welfare state adjustment. Technology, however, is not social destiny. Societies can - and do - respond to these challenges very differently, which in turn changes the nature and trajectory of digitalization itself. The question then becomes: why do countries react different to digitalization, why do some deregulate while other re-regulate, why do digital platforms win some political battles but lose others? In this course, we will look at political responses to a particular set of challenges posed by digitalization: those that stem from its commodifying thrust. Commodification has two dimensions here. First, digitalization creates markets for things that were previously walled off from commercial exploitation, with the commodification of personal data and the emergence of markets for human attention being the most important example. Second, digitalization allows actors to circumvent decommodifying institutions that are meant to protect individuals from the vagaries of the market. The systematic violation of labor law by companies like Uber - who insist that their drivers are independent contractors in order to avoid labor regulations - is the most important example here. Throughout the course, we try to understand digital capitalism as well as the political responses to it, drawing on recent theoretical and empirical studies covering not just Europe but other countries as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning Outcomes</h1>
<p>The course aims to familiarize students with central theoretical insights and empirical findings from the emerging literature on the (comparative) politics and political economy of digitalization. At the end of the course, students should be able to</p>
<ul>
<li><p>describe and understand how digitalization is commodifying, but also how it is not just a technologically but a deeply political and politically contested process;</p></li>
<li><p>explain why digital companies are sometimes regulated and sometimes not and summarize the key theoretical insights and empirical findings of the literature on the comparative politics of digitalization;</p></li>
<li><p>apply these insights to empirical projects of their own.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="requirements" class="section level1">
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>Students are required to attend classes and come prepared (i.e., having done and thought about the readings). In addition, there will be three types of assignments that together make up the final grade.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, for <strong>three</strong> sessions of their choosing, students need to write short response papers (half a page) that reflect on the readings and end with a question for the class (25%). And remember, questions end with a question mark.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, they are required to deliver a very short input presentation (around 5-10 minutes) for <strong>one</strong> session as well as prepare discussion points for the class (e.g., questions, empirical examples) (25%). The former is meant to quickly summarize the main points of the reading(s) and the latter is meant to kick off and organize the discussion.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, students need to write a relatively short term paper on a topic related to the course (up to 4000 words) (50%). The paper can be theoretical or empirical and is meant to hone in on one particular question that the students can pick themselves (although they should briefly discuss this with us in advance).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="prerequisites" class="section level1">
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Students need no prior knowledge of academic debates on digitalization to successfully participate in the course. A general interest in the topic, basic English language skills, and a broad familiarity with the European Union are sufficient.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-policy" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Policy</h1>
<p>Basically, don’t cheat and try to learn stuff, details follow below.</p>
<div id="grading-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<p>You need to submit all the required assignments to pass the course. Your final grade will be the weighted average of these assignments. What is important to us when it comes to grading are two things. First, stick to the task at hand. If your response paper is meant to end with a question, end with a question. If your presentation is meant to be 5 minutes, make it no more than 6. If your term paper is meant to discuss one question in around 4000 words, don’t try to answer half a dozen in 8000 words. It’s almost a dad thing to say, but these skills are important not just at a university, but in every type of job. Second, put a bit of effort into it, or at least make it look that way. Have some decent formatting. But also, try to be clear and crisp, which is often harder than writing long and convoluted sentences. Try to prepare a presentation that you yourself would like to listen to: short, clear points, that highlight anything that you found confusing or unclear. You don’t need to understand everything, have read a ton of additional literature, or write in the most elaborate way to get a very good grade. Just stick to the task and try to make sense.</p>
</div>
<div id="e-mail-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>E-mail Policy</h2>
<p>You can always email us if you have an idea for a term paper, if you want to learn more about a certain topic and don’t know where to start, or if you have a question that you really don’t want to ask in class. Please don’t email us with questions that you could easily find the answer to in the syllabus or in previous emails. We might take it badly.</p>
<p>This is a tough time for many, so if you feel like you struggle to cope or just need to get an outside perspective, please get in touch with the Psychological Counseling Center: <a href="https://www.studierendenberatung.at/en" class="uri">https://www.studierendenberatung.at/en</a></p>
</div>
<div id="attendance-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>You are required to attend each session, and we encourage you to prepare for and actively participate in them. However, if you really can’t make it, just reach out to us, these things happen once or twice a term.</p>
