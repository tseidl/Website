##Introduction round 

<br>

- What's your name?
 
- What do you study?
 
- What aspect of digital power Europe are you particularly interested in?
 
- Which platform/service by tech giants do you feel most conflicted about using – but use anyway?

---
## Course Policy

<br>

- *Zoom*: Please don't make us speak to a black wall!

- *Response Papers*: Please upload them until 18:00 two days before the seminar (i.e. on Tuesday evening)

- *Grading*: For individual assignments, we use a 15 point scale (with 15 being the highest and 0 being the lowest score), which we'll later convert into your grade. 

- *Feedback*: If you want more extensive feedback on any of your assignments, just reach out to us!

---
## Requirements
Students are required to attend classes and come prepared (i.e., having finished and thought about the readings). In addition, there will be three types of assignments that together make up the final grade.

-	First, for three sessions of their choosing, students need to write short response papers (half a page) that reflect on the readings and end with a question for the class (25%). And remember, questions end with a question mark.

-	Second, they are required to deliver a very short input presentation (around 5-10 minutes) for one session as well as prepare discussion points for the class (e.g., questions, empirical examples) (25%). The former is meant to quickly summarize the main points of the reading(s) and the latter is meant to kick off and organize the discussion.

-	Lastly, students need to write a relatively short term paper on a topic related to the course (up to 4000 words) (50%). The paper can be theoretical or empirical and is meant to hone in on one particular question that the students can pick themselves (although they should briefly discuss this with us in advance).

# Exercise I

<br>

### What characterises a big-data mindset? Read the case study on *Decide.com* and identify core characteristics.



---

## Case Study: *Decide.com*

<br>

<font size="4.9"> 

IN 2011 A CLEVER STARTUP in Seattle called Decide.com opened its online doors with fantastically bold ambitions. It wanted to be a price-prediction engine for zillions of consumer products. But it planned to start relatively modestly: with every possible tech gadget, from mobile phones and flat-screen televisions to digital cameras. Its computers sucked down data feeds from e-commerce sites and scoured the Web for any other price and product information they could find.

Prices on the Web constantly change throughout the day, dynamically updating based on countless, intricate factors. So the company needed to collect pricing data at all times. It isn’t just big data but “big text” too, since the system had to analyze words to recognize when a product was being discontinued or a newer model was about to launch, information that consumers ought to know and that affects prices.

A year later, Decide.com was analyzing four million products using over 25 billion price observations. It identified oddities about retailing that people had never been able to “see” before, like the fact that prices might temporarily increase for older models once new ones are introduced. Most people would purchase the older one figuring it would be cheaper, but depending on when they clicked “buy,” they might pay more. As online stores increasingly use automated pricing systems, Decide.com can spot unnatural, algorithmic price spikes and warn consumers to wait. The company’s predictions, according to its internal measurements, are accurate 77 percent of the time and provide buyers with average potential savings of around $100 per product. So confident is the company, that in cases where its predictions prove incorrect, Decide.com will reimburse the price difference to paying members of the service.

## Methapors we live by



>“Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature. (...) New metaphors are capable of creating new understandings and, therefore, new realities." <br>	&mdash; George Lakoff, Metaphors We Live By

<br>

Data as

- oil

- capital

- water

- a tool

class:inverse, center, middle

# Exercise II

<br>

### What do the different methaphors imply for what data is and how it should be treated?

---

## Two Paradoxes of AI

<br>

- **Polanyi's Paradox**: States that humans constantly draw on tacit knowledge that they struggle to articulate and define even to themselves, making it very hard to specify it in computer code.

<br>

<br>

- **Moravec’s Paradox**: States that it is hard for computers to do many tasks that are easy for humans, and conversely, computers can do many things that we find exceedingly difficult.



???

"We know more than we can tell.”

Example: To illustrate Polanyi’s point, it is helpful to contrast the task of repetitive assembly with that of designing a new car, writing a piece of music, or giving a galvanizing speech. The rules for what makes a good song or a great speech are hard to define because there are none.


*Example*: “It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance in solving problems on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills
of a one- year- old when it comes to perception and mobility."

## Three Observations by the MIT <br> Work of the Future Task Force

<br>

1. Momentous impacts of technological change are unfolding gradually.

2. Rising labor productivity has not translated into broad increases in incomes because labor market institutions and policies have fallen into disrepair.

3. Improving the quality of jobs requires innovation in labor market institutions.




**&rArr; There is time to react, but also the necessity!**

## Problems with the <br> Normative Power Europe Argument


<br>

- Can we really separate norms and interests that easily?

- Are European values not also contested *within* Europe?

- Is Normative Power Europe a descriptive/explanatory or a normative/critical argument?

- Is it plausible to assume that its history, its nature as a hybrid polity, and its political and legal framework "predisposes it [the EU] to act in a normative way" (Manners 2002, p. 242)?

- How do we deal with the 'performativity' of the theory, i.e., that actors use Normative Power Europe as a discursive tool to create an identity but also an Other?




???

Take EU policy towards the Maghreb, for instance. The insistence on migration control in ENP agreements may well be in the interest of Member States, yet its normative assessment is much more problematic, as there is no undisputed norm in favour of migration. The judgement on this issue will therefore always be essentially a political one, and depend on the analyst’s normative views, however honourable they may be (Diez, 2013)

Also, one could argue for dropping the against one's interest part but retain the shaping what is normal part of the argument in some sort of *strategic constructivism*
