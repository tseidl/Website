Paper tiger-superhero dimension:  
  - ineffectual vs overpowered
  
cucumber-roaming dimension:
  - unresponsive, removed bureaucrats vs. sensible policymakers



General consensus that EU policies matter, from large (economic rules, privacy rights) to small (color of passports, labeling of potato crisps)

## About this Course

 
<br>

- EU policies matter, but how can we explain them?

> This course is about understanding "the processes that produce EU policies; that is, the decision (or non-decisions) by EU public authorities facing choices between alternative courses of public action" (Wallace et al. 2020, p. 6-7).

<br>

- This course is divided into **three** parts:

  - Theories of European integration (*EU as a process*)
  - Theories of EU policymaking (*EU as a polity*)
  - Case studies on specific policy areas



???

EU Integration theories: 

  - from IR, causes and direction of EU integration as a process, is it driven by member states or supranational actors?


Theories of EU policymaking: 

  - from comparative politics: treat EU as a political system, akin to domestic political systems

## The 'Polycrisis' & Integration Theories


.pull-left[


```{r out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/polycrisis.jpg")
```

]


.pull-right[

<br>


```{r out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

knitr::include_graphics("img/elephant.jpeg")
```


]

???

Two arguments:

- Europe forged in crisis, crises pivotal moments in European integration and therefore also for European integration theory, who are the important actors, what drives integration or disintegration?
Foil against which we will look at these theories

- Integration theories are partial, focus on specific things

???

"institutional triangle", but also other actors


Policy cycles as an analytic instrument rather than a causal theory

Agenda-Setting:

  - Deciding what to decide as crucial part of policymaking
  

Policy-Formulation:

  - formulation of policy alternatives
  
Decision-Making:

Who decides? (Delegation/Executive Decision-making vs. legislative politics (normal in EP, bargaining in council, inter-institutional?))

Implementation:

vague language, directives, political will


Feedback:

evaluations of effectiveness, political feedback loops (path-dependencies), spill-over (e.g. elimination of border controls requires cross-border cooperation in policing)
