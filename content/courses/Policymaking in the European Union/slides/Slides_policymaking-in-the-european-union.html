## Narratives on the European Union

&lt;img src="Slides_policymaking-in-the-european-union_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


???

Paper tiger-superhero dimension:  
  - ineffectual vs overpowered
  
cucumber-roaming dimension:
  - unresponsive, removed bureaucrats vs. sensible policymakers



General consensus that EU policies matter, from large (economic rules, privacy rights) to small (color of passports, labeling of potato crisps)


---

## About this Course

 
&lt;br&gt;

- EU policies matter, but how can we explain them?

&gt; This course is about understanding "the processes that produce EU policies; that is, the decision (or non-decisions) by EU public authorities facing choices between alternative courses of public action" (Wallace et al. 2020, p. 6-7).

&lt;br&gt;

- This course is divided into **three** parts:

  - Theories of European integration (*EU as a process*)
  - Theories of EU policymaking (*EU as a polity*)
  - Case studies on specific policy areas



???

EU Integration theories: 

  - from IR, causes and direction of EU integration as a process, is it driven by member states or supranational actors?


Theories of EU policymaking: 

  - from comparative politics: treat EU as a political system, akin to domestic political systems

Two arguments:

- Europe forged in crisis, crises pivotal moments in European integration and therefore also for European integration theory, who are the important actors, what drives integration or disintegration?
Foil against which we will look at these theories

- Integration theories are partial, focus on specific things

"institutional triangle", but also other actors


Policy cycles as an analytic instrument rather than a causal theory

Agenda-Setting:

  - Deciding what to decide as crucial part of policymaking
  

Policy-Formulation:

  - formulation of policy alternatives
  
Decision-Making:

Who decides? (Delegation/Executive Decision-making vs. legislative politics (normal in EP, bargaining in council, inter-institutional?))

Implementation:

vague language, directives, political will


Feedback:

evaluations of effectiveness, political feedback loops (path-dependencies), spill-over (e.g. elimination of border controls requires cross-border cooperation in policing)

# Session 2: Neo-Functionalism

.footnote[

[Back to the contents slide](#contents-slide)

]


---

## What is Neo-Functionalism?

&gt; "Neo-functionalism is a theory of market and political integration within a specific region constituted by those states that have taken a formal decision to integrate" (Sandholtz &amp; Stone Sweet 2012, p. 19). Specifically, it asks, "whether and how economic integration leads to political integration." (Jensen, 2019, p. 58).



Neo-Functionalism posits a 

- **broadening** and **deepening** supranational competences

- **three** main mechanisms of this supranationalizaiton of competences:

    - Spillover
    - Elite Socialization
    - Formation of supranational interest groups
    
The supranational governance approach directly builds on this, but focuses more on transnational exchange, EU rules, and supranational institutions.



???

Schimmelfennig 2014: What unites the different versions of neofunctionalism is the idea of a dynamic and progressive integration process that transcends its intergovernmental origins as a result of endogenous interdependencies, spillovers and path-dependencies."

Difference supranational governance: 

The supranational governance approach "emphasizes the role of transnational exchange, EU rules, and supranational institutions. They argue that cross-border transactions generate a demand for Community rules, which EC institutions seek to supply. Once Community legislation develops, supranational society emerges as (business) actors realize that one set of rules is preferable to numerous sets of (national)
rules." (Niemann 2015)

However, in his revised theory Schmitter rejects the “automaticity of spillover” assumption. Strategic responses other than spillover are conceptualized, such as (a) “spill-around,” the proliferation of functionally specialized independent, but strictly intergovernmental, institutions; (b) “build-up,” the concession by Member States of greater authority to the supranational organization without expanding the scope of its mandate; (c) and (d) “spill-back,” which denotes withdrawal from previous commitments by member states.

## Example: Judicial Activism

*Dassonville* (C-8/74, 11 July 1974) &amp; *Cassis de Dijon* (C-120/78, 20 February 1979)

  - Expansive interpretation of the law: from non-discrimination to non-restriction
  - Principle of mutual recognition: goods lawfully sold in one member state can also be sold in any other EU country

???

Initially, the “four freedoms”—the free movement of goods, capital, services, and persons—aimed at guaranteeing discrimination-free transnational access to the member states’ markets. Since its pathbreaking Dassonville and Cassis de Dijon decisions, however, the ECJ has replaced the principle of nondiscrimination by the principle of nonrestriction. According to the nonrestriction principle, every national regulation that restricts the transnational exercise of one of the four freedoms is in potential violation of European law, even if the regulation is discrimination-free, that is, imposed equally on nationals and nonnationals alike. This reinterpretation has far-reaching implications for the scope of market-enforcing integration. Interpreted as individual rights for restriction-free market action, the four freedoms can now be used not merely to eliminate disguised protectionism on the part of the member states, but rather to target a wide variety of member states’ political regulations as obstacles to European law. Furthermore, this line of ECJ rulings not only targets political regulation but also—due to the legal doctrine on the horizontal effect of European law—the actions of private bodies such as firms or trade unions.

Rewe, a large German retail company, wanted to import and sell Cassis de Dijon, a crème de cassis blackcurrant liqueur produced in France. The liqueur contained between 15 and 20 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV). Germany, however, had a law specifying that products sold as fruit liqueurs be over 25 per cent ABV. The Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein (Federal Monopoly Administration for Spirits), part of the Federal Ministry of Finance, informed Rewe that it would not be able to market Cassis in Germany as a liqueur.

## Task: How well - or poorly - does &lt;br&gt; Neo-Functionalism explain the Euro Crisis?

&lt;br&gt;

- Four Groups

- Group 1 &amp; 2: Arguments in Favor of Neo-Functionalism

- Group 3 &amp; 4: Arguments against Neo-Functionalism

---

## Neo-Functionalism and the Euro Crisis


.pull-left[

**Arguments in Favor of Neo-Functionalism**

- Spillover effects from monetary to fiscal and regulatory integration (Six-Pack, Two-Pack, Banking Union, ESM)

- Business groups overwhelmingly in favor of saving the Euro and more integration

- Important role of EU actors, especially the ECB

- ...

]

.pull-right[

**Arguments not in Favor of Neo-Functionalism**


- Crucial decisions taken by national governments (and the German chancellor and French president in particular)

- 'Summitization' of European crisis responses

- Delegations not to existing supranational institutions such as the Commission but *de novo* bodies (see 'new intergovernmentalism')

- ...

]
---




## Questions 


- From the response papers:

  - Why are there not more "EUs"?

  - Is Neo-Functionalism overly focused on economic factors, downplaying identity concerns?

  - Is Neo-Functionalism to 'elitist', wrongly presupposing the tacit support of the European electorates for the integration efforts of elites. 


- From the presenters:

  - Can neo-functionalism explain why some countries, like Great Britain, never joined the monetary union or the “Schengen-Agreement”?
  
  - Can neo-functionalism be applied outside the European borders?
  
  - How can neo-functionalism be related to nationalism? 



???

Haas was originally interested in formulating a general theory of regional integration. Problem that it needs to be set in motion. Actors need to have sufficient common interests in agreeing to cooperate.


Niemann 2015: Fifth, neofunctionalists assume rational and self-interested actors (Haas 1970: 627), who (nevertheless) have the capacity to learn and change their preferences. Interest-driven national and supranational elites, recognizing the limitations of national solutions, learn from the benefits of regional policies and from their experiences in cooperative decision-making.

Niemann 2015: Fourth, neofunctionalists see the Community primarily as “a creature of elites.” While Haas (1958: chs. 5 and 6) devoted much of his attention to the role of nongovernmental elites, Lindberg (1963: ch. 4) largely focused on governmental elites. Neither ascribed much importance to the role of public opinion. The conclusion was that there was a “permissive consensus” in favor of European integration (Lindberg and Scheingold 1970: 41) and that this would suffice to sustain it.

## One Grand Theory, Three Smaller Ones

&lt;br&gt;
1. A Liberal Theory of Preference Formation

  - The goals of states are shaped on the domestic level, specifically by dominant, usually economic, groups.

2. A Intergovernmental (Game-)Theory of Bargaining

  - Hard Bargaining often under conditions of asymmetric interdependence.

3. A Theory of Institutional Delegation

  - Institutions are the result of inter-state bargaining and are designed to improve the efficiency of said bargaining, often to ensure credible commitments.
  
???

1. not shaped by the states' perception of their position in the international system. E.g., Moravcik: The vital interest behind de Gaulle's opposition to British membership in the EC was not the pursuit of French grandeur but the price of French wheat.

The game of chicken, also known as the hawk–dove game or snowdrift game,[1] is a model of conflict for two players in game theory. The principle of the game is that while the outcome is ideal for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yields), but the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. So each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part over. The name "chicken" has its origins in a game in which two drivers drive towards each other on a collision course: one must swerve, or both may die in the crash, but if one driver swerves and the other does not, the one who swerved will be called a "chicken", meaning a coward; this terminology is most prevalent in political science and economics. 



A Rambo game is a situation structure in which ‘one actor has a dominant strategy to defect, while the other must co-operate in order to avoid an even worse outcome’ (Hasenclever et al. 1997: 51). In contrast to the conflict between creditors and debtors in the euro crisis, which was stylized as a chicken game constellation, a Rambo game has no ‘common bad’ that actors jointly seek to avoid. Whereas mutual defection is the worst outcome for the disadvantaged player, it constitutes the Rambo’s, i.e., the advantaged player’s, second best result. This enables the Rambo to
impose its first best option, free-riding, on the disadvantaged player.

## Migration Crisis: Outcome Matrix
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;  **Table from Biermann, F. et al. (2019) ‘Political (non-)reform in the euro crisis and the refugee crisis: a liberal intergovernmentalist explanation’, Journal of European Public Policy, 26(2), pp. 246–266. doi: 10.1080/13501763.2017.1408670**

In its stylized form, the Rambo game has four potential outcomes. The first is a situation whereby Schengen and the Dublin system are temporarily suspended, unilateral policies prevail and migratory pressure is shifted almost completely onto the AS. This outcome can be characterized as mutual defection (DD), or what we call the de facto status quo. While the NAS do not accept any form of burden-sharing, the AS are responsible for the temporary suspension of Schengen as they unilaterally decide to reintroduce border controls in order to control the large influx of refugees. The second possible outcome, mutual co-operation (CC), implies a reform of the Dublin system, e.g., by introducing a permanent burden-sharing mechanism as well as the re-implementation of Schengen (European Commission 2016d). The third possible outcome is one of what could be called temporary solidarity (DC), with the NAS voluntarily accepting refugees to support the AS, but no overhaul of the system towards permanent burden-sharing.6 Finally, AS could return to the implementation of the de jure status quo (CD), i.e., they could decide to comply with the Dublin system and with Schengen, without any burden-sharing and further reform.


AS: [CC &gt; DC &gt; CD &gt; DD]

NAS: [CD &gt; DD &gt; DC &gt; CC]

The AS’s most preferred outcome is political reform (CC), e.g., a reform of the Dublin system in order to preserve the benefits of Dublin/Schengen rules and to reduce migratory pressure through a burden-sharing mechanism. If further integration through reforms is, however, not obtainable, the AS’s second-best option would be a display of temporary solidarity on the part of the NAS, which would reduce migratory pressure in the short term (DC). In order to secure the benefits of prior co-operation and given the lack of solidarity demonstrated by NAS, the AS’s third-best outcome would be to take unilateral measures towards the re-implementation of Dublin and Schengen – even if this implies that the burden of migratory pressure is to be borne by the AS themselves (CD). Consequently, their worst outcome would be to maintain the de facto status quo in which migratory pressure is high, Dublin is not reformed and Schengen suspended (DD). In other words, the preference order of the AS in Figure 2 can be described as [CC &gt; DC &gt; CD &gt; DD]. In contrast, the NAS oppose the AS’s preference for political reform.

The NAS optimal outcome is thus the de jure status quo, which would provide for the reintroduction of and effective compliance with Schengen and Dublin, and prevent mandatory redistributive measures (CD). This would enable NAS to minimize migratory pressure and to capture the benefits provided by the Dublin/Schengen system. Even though they share an interest in the functioning of the Dublin/Schengen system, they value the absence of a burden-sharing mechanism more highly, preferring the de facto status quo (DD) over both integration (CC) and temporary solidarity (DC). Owing to widespread anti-immigrant resentment among their citizenry, some NAS expressed an unwillingness to accept the slightest increase of refugee numbers on their territory. Thus, the NAS preference order, reflected in Figure 2, can be depicted as [CD &gt; DD &gt; DC &gt; CC]. The Nash equilibrium in this preference constellation is the de jure status quo (CD). Since the AS anticipate the NAS’s (i.e., the Rambo’s) unwillingness to co-operate, and in order to avoid their worst outcome, the suspension of Dublin/Schengen, the AS unilaterally carry the crisis-induced burden.

## Grounds for Delegation: &lt;br&gt; Example Competition Policy







&lt;img src="Slides_policymaking-in-the-european-union_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



???

The economy-wide PMR indicators measure the regulatory barriers to firm entry and competition in a broad range of key policy areas, ranging from licensing and public procurement, to governance of SOEs, price controls, evaluation of new and existing regulations, and foreign trade.

Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018) We argue that bargaining among sovereign nations leads to supranational institutions that are more politically in de pen dent than what the average politician would choose. We build a formal economic model to show that this is exactly what game theory predicts. Imagine a world where politicians and civil servants design a regulator and can make it more or less in de pen dent from business and political influence. Our key result is that this degree of in dependence is strictly higher when two countries set up a common regulator than when each country has its own regulator. The key insight is that politicians are more worried about the regulator being captured by the other country than they are attracted by the opportunity to capture the regulator themselves. French and German politicians might not like a strong and in de pen dent antitrust regulator at home, but they like even less the idea of the other nation exerting political influence over the institution. As a result, if they are to agree on any supranational institution, it will have a bias toward more independence.

## What distinghuishes Post-Functionalism &lt;br&gt; from Neo-Funtionalism and Intergouvernmentalism?


&lt;br&gt;


1. Preferences are not only economic but also identity-based.

  &amp;rarr;  Agnosticism about whether decision making or its outcome will be characterized by functionality.
  
2. It is not only elites (policymakers and interest groups) that matter, but citizens as well.

  &amp;rarr; We cannot assume a permissive consensus but must take seriously the possibility of a constraining dissensus
  
  
--

&amp;rArr; In a nutshell, postfunctionalism posits a *basic tradeoff between the functional scale of governance and the territorial scope of community*.

## Postfunctionalism's Theoretical Framework


&lt;img src="img/postfunctionalism.PNG" width="67%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## The Logic of Politicization


&lt;br&gt;

- Politicization refers to the increasing contentiousness of decision making (in the process of regional integration), specifically (cf. Börzel &amp; Risse 2018):

  - Increasing issue salience of European affairs
  - Increasing levels of polarization pertaining to the EU
  - Increasing mobilization and expansion of actors

- Political entrepreneurs (e.g. right-wing parties) can politicize an issue when they hope to gain an electoral advantage from doing so


&amp;rarr; If an issue is politicized, mass politics trumps interest group politics.

&amp;rarr; If collective identity is framed as exclusive, European integration will stall.



???

"Thus, the postfunctionalist era is not about a widening gap between public and élite support for European integration per se. The gulf between the publics and élites of Europe has always been wide (Hooghe 2003). What has eroded the ‘permissive consensus’, which used to enable European élites to push integration forward without much domestic resistance (Hooghe and Marks 2009), is that the EU has become increasingly politicized." (Börzel &amp; Risse 2018)

Counter-Example Euro Crisis (Schimmelfennig 2014)

In sum, the financial crisis has produced all ingredients for a ‘postfunctionalist moment’ in European integration. EU policy has arguably become more domestically salient, controversial and politicized than ever before. Budget controls and austerity measures demanded by the EU have imposed losses on large groups of people in the debtor countries. They have sparked mass protests, a loss in trust and support for the EU, widespread snap elections and changes in government. According to the post-functionalist scenario, we should have observed a strong constraining dissensus leading to decision-making blockades at the EU level, stagnation and even setbacks in integration or an increase in differentiated integration as a consequence. And yet, the EU has embarked on a far-reaching reconstruction of EMU resulting not only in the preservation of the Eurozone but also in a major leap of supranational and technocratic integration in fiscal and financial policy. How has this been possible? I propose in this article that governments have been able to shield Eurozone integration from the impact of politicization by forming euro-compatible governments, avoiding and constraining referendums on institutional reform and by delegating competences to supranational organizations

## Business Lobbying in the EU


- Contrary to common wisdom, business do not always get what it wants in European politics (e.g. Dür et al. 2019, Klüver 2013)

- Two questions: 

  - Why are business interests not more successful in EU policymaking?
  - What are the conditions under which they are successful?
  
  
- Two partial answers: 

  - Businesses are not always successful because the EU increasingly regulates markets beyond the regulation required to establish these markets in the first place (Dür et al. 2019, p. 6)
  - Businesses are more successful under conditions of low salience, unity, and when dealing with the right DGs or committees (Rasmussen 2015); under high salience, the benefits of diverse coalitions outweigh the cooperation costs of building such coalitions (Junk 2019)

# Exercise I

&lt;br&gt;

### Imagine your work as a lobbyist for Google.


#### Group 1 &amp; Group 2: Your job ist to make sure all things Google don't get too much public attention - which strategies would you use to keep the politics of digital policymaking quiet?

#### Group 3 &amp; Group 4: Group 1 &amp; 2 have failed. The public spotlight is on you: What would you do to still win the political battle?

class: inverse, center, middle

# Exercise II

&lt;br&gt;

### Use https://lobbyfacts.eu/

#### Which three companies spend most on lobbying/have the most lobbyists right now? 

#### How does that compare to the biggest spenders in 2012?

#### Are the companies that spend the most money today also the companies that get the most meetings with EU officials?

#### Browse the data and identify one thing that you find interesting/surprising/shocking?

## A Washingtonization of Brussels?

&lt;br&gt;

&gt; In the first half of 2020, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft declared spending a combined 19 million euros, or about $23 million, equal to what they had declared for all of 2019 and up from €6.8 million in 2014. (...) “The budgets are really unrivaled — we’ve never seen this kind of money being spent by companies directly,” said Margarida Silva, a researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, a group that tracks lobbying in Brussels. The totals are probably much higher, she noted, because disclosure rules do not capture all the spending on law firms, academic partnerships and activities in individual countries." &lt;br&gt; &amp;mdash; New York Times, 2020: Big Tech Turns Its Lobbyists Loose on Europe, Alarming Regulators

## Types of Agenda-Setting Power &lt;br&gt; (based on Deters &amp; Falkner 2021)

   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Main Examples &lt;/th&gt;

 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;

   &lt;td style="text-align:left;font-style: italic;"&gt; Procedural agenda-setting power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Formal ability (through decision rules) to make it easier to adopt the agenda-setter's preferred policy than to amend it &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; First Face of Power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Commission, CJEU &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;font-style: italic;"&gt; Gatekeeping power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Formal prerogative of a structural first mover to uphold the status quo by excluding alternatives from even being discussed and setting the limits of feasible policy options &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Second Face of Power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; CJEU, Commission &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;font-style: italic;"&gt; Agenda leadership &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Ability to 'rally consensus' for a proposal when decision-makers are largely indifferent about competing solutions (when there are multiple negotiations equilibria) &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Influence through appeal to enlightened self-interest &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; European Council, Commission &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;font-style: italic;"&gt; Discursive agenda-setting power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Ability to influence how an issue is perceived by potential decision-makers and stakeholders and thus manipulate - through cognitive or normative framing - the scope and nature of a conflict &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Third Face of Power &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; European Parliament, European Council, Interest Groups &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Substring matching (e.g. via the Smith–Waterman local alignment algorithm or the Damerau-Levenshtein minimum edit distance) can be employed to detect instances of coordination among interest groups since it allows us to identify similar passages of text between two documents that are not perfectly overlapping (Scott et al. 2020, RIPE; Pagliari &amp; Young 2020, JEPP; Rauh 2020, EUP)

## Text Re-Use Approaches II


.pull-left[




The Commission's legislative agenda-setting power allows it "to select and to propose the one policy from the set of all feasible ones that comes closest to its own preferences. (...) I argue that the Commission’s legislative influence hinges strongly on the quality of anticipation it can muster. (...) Correctly anticipating the political leeway it enjoys for a given initiative is a necessary condition for the Commission’s legislative success. Yet, carving out this leeway is a resource-intensive business [and the individual DGs] are not created equal in this regard. " &amp;mdash; Rauh 2020, EUP
