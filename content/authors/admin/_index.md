IÂ´m a PhD Researcher at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/) in Florence, Italy. I previously studied at the Universities of Augsburg, Oslo, Frankfurt and Toronto.

In my resarch, I try to show how the current digital transformation of economies and societies is not just a technological or economic process, but is profoundly shaped by the political and cultural environment in which it unfolds. I am also interested in how and when ideas matter in politics and social life, and how we can best measure that. You can learn about my research interests [here](/research).

If you are here for a list of my publications or working papers, or the accompanying appendices or replication materials, you can find them [here](/publication). If you just want to throw a quick glance at my CV, you only have to click [here](files/CV_Seidl.pdf).

What do I do besides thinking about politics and the like? Well, Bismarck once quipped that his passions resemble the trout in his pond: one eats up the other until all that remains is one fat old trout. Thus has his passionate love for politics devoured all his other passions. To make sure it won't come to that, I am careful to carve out some protected spaces for the smaller trout in my pond: the passion for the mountains, vegetarian food, the daily thinking stroll, and the occasional bar or board game evening.
