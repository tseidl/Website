I´m a PhD Researcher at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/) in Florence, and currently a visiting researcher at [Humboldt University](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society](https://www.hiig.de/) in Berlin. I previously studied at the Universities of Augsburg, Oslo, Frankfurt and Toronto.

In my resarch, I try to show how the current digital transformation of economies and societies is not just a technological or economic process, but is profoundly shaped by the political and cultural environment in which it unfolds. You can learn about my research interests [here](/publication) and you can find my CV here.

Beyond academia
=

Bismarck once said that his passions resemble the trout in his pond: one eats up the other until there remains only one fat old trout. Thus his passionate love for politics has devoured all his other passions. To make sure that my passion for the social sciences does not get “fatter” than it already is, I try to cultivate my other passions as well, from hiking to playing board and card games to learning another vegetarian recipe once in a while.
