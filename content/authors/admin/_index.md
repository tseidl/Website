IÂ´m a PhD Researcher at the Department of Political and Social Sciences at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/) in Florence, Italy. I previously studied at the Universities of Augsburg, Oslo, Frankfurt and Toronto. In my research, I try to show how the current digital transformation of economies and societies is not just a technological or economic process, but is profoundly shaped by politics and power. I am particularly interested in the role of ideas in political and social life, and how we can trace and measure their effects. 

Check out my [CV](files/CV_Seidl.pdf) to find out more about me. If you're still interested, I write in more detail about my research interests [here](/research). You can also browse my publications and look at accompanying materials such as appendices, data, slides, or interviews [here](/publication). I also publish the syllabi (and slides) of courses I teach, you can find them [here](/teaching). Lastly, I recently started reviewing books on tech and politics, take a look [here](/post). And if you want to stay or get in touch, just follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Timo_Seidl) or drop me an email at <timo.seidl@outlook.com>.

Bismarck once quipped that his passions resemble the trout in his pond: one eats up the other until all that remains is one fat old trout. Thus has his passionate love for politics devoured all his other passions. To make sure it won't come to that, I am careful to carve out space for the smaller, non-academic trout in my pond as well: the passion for the mountains, the daily thinking stroll, the occasional bar or board game evening, and, more recently, generative aRt in R.
